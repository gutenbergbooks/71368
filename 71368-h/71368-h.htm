</div>

<p class='c006'>Advanced work in the study of poultry husbandry is now being
done in this country, to a greater or less extent, at all the two score
and more Agricultural and other Colleges and Experiment Stations.
From these institutions comes the demand for a text-book on the
Anatomy of the Domestic Fowl. No complete text-book on the
subject, up to the present, has existed. It is with the hope of
meeting the demand that this book is published.</p>

<p class='c007'>In supplementing the information gathered from the books and
articles listed in the bibliography, the author has spent much time
and effort in obtaining the matter here presented. As this, however,
is the initial complete text on the subject necessarily much remains
to be added and corrected. The author would welcome suggestions
and corrections from any one into whose hands the book may come.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Osseous Structure.</b>—Bone is structurally modified connective
tissue which has become hard by being impregnated with calcium
salts.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Kinds of Bone Tissue.</i>—There are two kinds of bone tissue:
substantia compacta, or compact bone tissue; and substantia spongiosa,
or spongy, cancellous bone tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Compact Bone Tissue.</i>—The compact bone tissue forms the hard
outer layer of all bones. It is thickest in the shaft and becomes thin
toward the extremities. Through the compact bone tissue approximately
parallel with the longitudinal axis of the bone, run canals
called <i>Haversian canals</i>, through which pass blood and lymph vessels
for the nourishment of the bone and nerves. The Haversian
canals are surrounded by <i>concentric lamellæ</i>. The spaces between
the cylinders thus formed are filled with <i>interstitial lamellæ</i>; and
both the exterior surface of the bone and the interior surface surrounding
the medullary canal, are built up of peripheral, or circumferential
lamellæ. Between the lamellæ, somewhat irregularly
placed, are minute reservoirs, called <i>lacunæ</i>, which contain bone
corpuscles. From the lacunæ radiate minute canals, or <i>canaliculi</i>,
which maintain circulation through the bone substance, and
which communicate with the Haversian canals. Complex anastomoses
exist among the canaliculi. Still other channels for the passage
of blood-vessels are Volkmann’s canals which pierce the peripheral
lamellæ, thus allowing vessels to pass from the periosteum to
the Haversian canals. Similar channels afford communication
between the inner Haversian canals and the medullary cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire structure composed of an Haversian canal, its surrounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>lamellæ, lacunæ, and canaliculi, with their contained
vessels, is called an <i>Haversian system</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Cancellous Bone Tissue.</i>—The cancellous bone tissue forms the
bulk of the short, flat, and irregular bones and of the extremities
of the long bones. It consists of delicate bony plates and spicules,
which intercross in various directions. The spaces between these
plates and spicules, called <i>cancelli</i>, are occupied by marrow except in
the bones that are pneumatic. The blood-vessels, lymphatics, and
nerves course through this marrow but are not arranged in an Haversian
system.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>The Periosteum.</i>—Covering the surface of bone, except at the
articular surface where it is covered with cartilage, is a membrane,
the periosteum, which consists of two layers: an outer, fibrous,
protective layer, and an inner, cellular, osteogenic layer. The outer
layer consists principally of white fibrous tissue. The inner layer
contains many more connective-tissue cells, which gradually become
more closely aggregated as we proceed toward the osseous
surface; but there is no sharply defined line of demarcation between
the two periosteal layers.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The periosteum is firmly attached to the bone by trabeculæ of
fibrous tissue, called the <i>fibers of Sharpey</i>. These fibers of Sharpey
penetrate the bone at right angles to its surface and carry blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Marrow.</i>—There are two kinds of marrow: yellow, or medulla
ossium flava, and red, or medulla ossium rubra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>yellow marrow</i> occurs in all bones except the femur and proximal
portion of the tibia of adult fowls. It is composed of a network
of fibrous tissue carrying blood-vessels, fat cells, and myelocytes, or
marrow cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>red marrow</i> is found throughout the femur and the proximal
portion of the tibia, and in a few of the pelvic bones and vertebræ
in the adult fowl, and in certain other bones of the baby chick.
Red marrow consists of a delicate network of connective tissue
supporting a dense capillary plexus, a small amount of fat, and
numerous cells. The cellular elements of red marrow consist of
marrow cells which contain large nuclei and possess ameboid movement,
red blood cells, giant cells containing one or more nuclei, and
various kinds of leucocytes, including eosinophiles, mast cells, and
also osteoclasts.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Growth of Bone.</i>—In the baby chick, only the shaft and a portion
of the extremities of the long bones are thoroughly ossified, the extreme
ends, and of the femur most of the articular head, being
cartilaginous. The bones grow in length by an increase in the cartilage,
the cartilage gradually becoming ossified. Growth in diameter
is accomplished by the constant deposition of new layers of bone
beneath the periosteum. During this process the osteoclasts absorb
the bone from within. The formation of the marrow cavity is
thus effected.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Classification of Bones.</b>—The bones of the fowl are classified
as long, short, flat, and irregular.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Long Bones.</i>—The long bones occur in the legs and wings, where
they serve as levers to sustain weight and make locomotion possible.
A long bone consists of a shaft and two extremities. The superior
is called the <i>proximal</i> and the inferior the <i>distal extremity</i>. The
expanded articular surfaces in forming joints with adjoining bones
afford ample space for the attachment of ligaments. The shaft is
cylindrical and hollow.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Short Bones.</i>—Short bones occur in the feet and in the wings.
Their structure is similar to that of the long bones.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>Flat Bones.</i>—The flat bones occur where extensive protection
is needed, as in the cranial region; or where large surface for muscular
attachments is needed, as in the costal and pelvic regions. Flat
bones are made up of two thin layers of compact bone with a variable
amount of cancellous tissue interposed.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Irregular Bones.</i>—The irregular bones include the vertebræ,
the patellæ, and the carpal bones.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Composition of Bone.</b>—Bone consists of organic and inorganic
matter. Organic matter gives toughness and elasticity to the bone,
and inorganic matter hardness. The organic substance of bone is
called ossein. When boiled in water ossein is resolved into gelatin.

<p class='c007'>The inorganic matter of the femur of the hen consists of 18.68
parts or 22.84 per cent. of dry matter, and the organic matter of
77.16 per cent. Stated in other words the femur, including its
contained marrow, consists of organic and inorganic matter in the
ratio of 3.4, approximately, to 1.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Skeleton of the Fowl.</b>—The skeleton of a bird is remarkable
for the rapidity of its ossification. It is worthy of note that other
parts of the bodies of adult birds also become ossified. Among such
parts are the tendons of the muscles of the legs, of the feet, and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>neck; the plates of the corneal margin of the sclerotic tunic of the
eye; and the stapes of the ear. Ossification in birds at the attachments
of the semi-lunar valves of the aorta and of the pulmonary
artery has been reported by Owen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bony structure is compact, and the bones contain a greater
proportion of phosphate of lime than do the osseous structures
of mammals. Especially is this the case in those parts of the
skeleton which are permeated by air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bodies of birds contain many air reservoirs to make them
light that flying may be more easy. Many bones have their weight
in proportion to size and strength thus greatly reduced. In very
young birds the cavities of bones contain, instead of air spaces,
loosely arranged red marrow, which is in most bones later absorbed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The air reservoirs in bones are most capacious in the best flyers.
In the non-flyers more of the bones retain their red marrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bones supplied with air spaces are relatively larger than
in mammals, and are provided with small transverse osseous columns
which cross in different directions and from side to side. These cross
beams give stability to the thin wall of the bone. The membranes
lining these cavities are very vascular.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>The Axial Skeleton</span></h3>

<h4 class='c014'>THE SKULL</h4>

<p class='c015'>The skull is divided into the cranial and facial portions. In
these parts we find present 31 bones: one occipital, two parietal, two
frontal, one ethmoid, one sphenoid, and two temporal; all of which
constitute the cranial group; two premaxillary, two maxillæ, two
nasal, two lacrimal, two palatine, two pterygoid, two zygomatic,
one vomeral, the two jugal, and two quadrato-jugal, which constitute
the facial group; two quadrati and one inferior maxillary, which
constitute the inferior jaw group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peculiarities of the skull are the long os incisivum and the
single condyle located on the occipital bone just below the foramen
magnum. The condyle articulates with the atlas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head of the bird is small in proportion to the size of the
body, and in front it is conical in shape.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Cranium</span></h5>

<p class='c015'>The cranial cavity, or cavum cranii, incloses the brain with its
membranes and vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dorsal wall, or roof, is formed by the frontal and the parietal
bones. In the median line of the cerebral portion is the internal
parietal crest. The roof of the cerebellar portion is marked centrally
by a groove.</p>

<p class='c007'>The posterior wall of the cerebellum is formed by the occipital
bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lateral wall is formed chiefly by the temporal bone. It is
marked by a ridge which divides the cavity into the cerebral and
cerebellar compartments. The cerebral portion is marked by a
depression which receives the optic lobes. A crest divides this
cavity from the optic portion. The walls are marked by digitations
and vascular grooves.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The ventral wall, floor, or basis cranii interna, may be regarded
as forming five fossæ. These are: one anterior, one middle, one
posterior, and two lateral. The <i>anterior fossa</i> supports the frontal
and olfactory parts of the cerebrum. It lies at a higher level than
the middle fossa. The <i>middle fossa</i>, or <i>fossa cranii media</i>, is circular
in outline and extends into the lateral fossæ which lodge the olfactory
lobes. Just back of the middle fossa is the sulla turcica,
upon which rests the pituitary body. The <i>posterior fossa</i>, or <i>fossa
cranii posterior</i>, lodges the medulla oblongata.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Bones of the Cranium</b> (Figs. 4, 6, 7, and 8).—The bones of the
cranium fuse early in the chick’s life. The sutures uniting the
bones can usually be seen in the fetus or in the baby chick soon
after it emerges from the shell. The major portion of the cranial
bones become entirely fused. Each cranial and each facial bone
ossifies from a distinct center or centers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cavity for the cerebrum is much larger than the cavity
for the cerebellum. The cranial cavities in birds are relatively
larger than in mammals. The bones are designated as in mammals.
There are three single bones, the occipital, the ethmoid, and the
sphenoid. Those in pairs are the frontal, the parietal, and the
temporal.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Occipital.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The occipital bone or os occipitale,
is situated at the posterior part of the cranium, of which it forms the
posterior wall. This part is called the base of the cranium. The
occipital bone articulates with or touches inferiorly, the sphenoid,
laterally, the temporal, and superiorly, the parietal.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Development.</i>—The occipital bone is developed from four centers
of ossification; the dorsal, or os occipitale superius, two lateral, or
ossa occipitales laterales, and the ventral, or os occipitale inferius,
all of which may be seen distinct in the baby chick (Fig. 5, Part II,
No. 1).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i>Description.</i>—In the center of the occipital bone is the <i>foramen
magnum</i>. Through this foramen the spinal cord extends into
the cranial cavity and connects with the medulla oblongata. The
occipital bone has a single condyle, which is located just below the
foramen magnum and articulates with the atlas. At the base of
the condyle a small <i>subcondyloid fossa</i> receives the body of the atlas
during extreme flexion of the head. In the center of the lateral
wing of the occipital bone there is a small foramen through which
passes the hypoglossal nerve. Somewhat laterally from this foramen
there is an opening through which the vagus, or pneumogastric
nerve passes. Laterally from these is the <i>canalis caroticus et jugularis</i>.
Between the os occipitale superius, or dorsal portion,
and the ossa parietalia is a space to which ligaments are attached,
called the fontanel.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The ethmoid consists of a perpendicular and a
horizontal lamina. The perpendicular lamina, located between
the orbital cavities, is called the <i>septum interorbitale</i>. On each side
of the septum interorbitale and near the superior orbital roof are
two foramina for the passage of the olfactory nerves. In the horizontal

<p class='c006'><b>The Sphenoid.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The sphenoid, or os sphenoidale,
forms the floor of the cranial cavity and articulates with or touches
posteriorly the occipital, laterally the temporal, and anteriorly the
palatine, and ethmoid.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The sphenoid bone, the largest part of the cranial
floor, is formed by the fusion of the nasal and the cranial parts. It is
a three-cornered bone with two, thin, broad wings. These wings
are divided into two portions, orbital wings, or <i>alæ orbitales</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>temporal wings, or <i>alæ temporales</i>. The temporal wing forms a
cover for the Eustachian tube trumpet, and for the canal coming
from the sella turcica, which latter gives passage to the intracranial
carotid artery. The orbital wing forms the lower portion of the
posterior wall of the orbital cavity, and lies directly before the os
petrosum or temporal bone where the second and third branches
of the fifth pair of cranial nerves emerge from the cranial cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anteriorly the sphenoid has a foramen for the passage of the
Eustachian tube, the <i>tuba auditiva</i>, and also a sharp-pointed projection,
the nasal portion, called the <i>rostrum</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Frontal.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The frontal bones, or ossa frontales, two
in number, form the forehead, a portion of the nose, and a portion
of the roof of the orbital cavities. They are related posteriorly with
the parietal, laterally with the temporal and zygomatic, and anteriorly
with the nasal and premaxillary. They touch inferiorly the
ethmoid.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—Each of these bones has a <i>processus orbitalis</i> which
is seen at the outer margin of the posterior and upper orbital wall
and just in front of the zygomatic process of the squamous
portion of the temporal. The frontal bone forms the anterior
portion of the superior wall of the cranial cavity. The two bones are
thin, flat, and meet at the median line of the forehead. The external
surface is convex. The inner surface has a ridge located longitudinally
and in the center the bone becomes narrow anteriorly.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Parietal.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The parietal bones, or ossa parietalia,
two in number, form the posterior part of the roof of the cranial
cavity. They meet in the median line and are related posteriorly
with the occipital, anteriorly with the frontal, and laterally with the
temporal bones.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The parietal bones are short and very broad (Fig.
5, Part II, No. 8). Each bone is quadrilateral in outline and has
two surfaces, four borders and four angles. The external parietal
surface is convex and smooth and the internal, cerebral surface is
concave.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Temporal.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The temporal bones, or ossa temporales,
two in number, are located at the lateral portion of the cranium, and
aid in the formation of the cranial wall. The temporal bone is related
posteriorly with the occipital, superiorly with the parietal and frontal,
externally with the quadratus, anteriorly with the ethmoid, and
inferiorly with the sphenoid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>squamous portion</i> of the temporal bone possesses the long
thin zygomatic process sometimes called the <i>posterior orbitalis</i>.
It forms a small flattened tongue, directed forward, sometimes
free, and at other times united by its superior border to the
summit of the orbital process. This is especially true in the turkey.
This process is seen near the lower outer portion of the posterior
orbital wall. The squamous portion is also provided antero-laterally
with an articular facet which articulates with the quadrate
bone. The large portion of the temporal bone lies on the side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the cranium superior to the ala sphenoida temporale. It extends
outward and anteriorly over the rims of the petrosum and ala
sphenoida orbitale. The squamous part forms the upper three-fourths
of the cochlea, the inner auditory canal, the upper part of
the fenestra ovalis, the anterior vertical and the outer semicircular
canal, and the lower part of the posterior vertical semicircular canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>petrous portion</i> forms the posterior wall of the foramen
ovale and the fenestra ovalis in which lies the columella. The
fenestra ovalis and the fenestra rotunda are the only two entrances
into the labyrinth. In this region may be seen the fusion line
between the os petrosum and the os occipitale. Superiorly and
posteriorly the petrous portion touches the external parietalia
and occipitalis; infero-laterally it unites with the basi-sphenoid.
The outer rim of the foramen ovale is broadened by the ala sphenoida
and mesially by the basi-sphenoid. This foramen gives exit
to the second and third divisions of the fifth pair of cranial nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lateral surface of the temporal bone presents a short tube,
the <i>external acoustic process</i>, or <i>processus acusticus externus</i>, to
which is attached the concha of the ear. The process is directed
outward. Its lumen, the <i>external acoustic meatus</i>, or <i>meatus acusticus
externus</i>, conducts to the cavity of the middle ear in the bare
skull, but is separated from it by the tympanic membrane in the
natural state.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Bones of the Face</span></h5>

<p class='c015'>The bones of the face, or ossa faciei, are the premaxillary, or
upper mandible, the maxillæ, the nasal, the lacrimal, the palatine,
the pterygoid, the zygomatic, the vomeral, the jugal and the
quadrato-jugal. The vomer is single, the others are paired. In the
inferior maxillary group there are the quadrati, and the inferior
maxillary, or lower mandible. The turbinated and hyoid bones
are also discussed with the bones of the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beak consists of the anterior portion of the upper and lower
mandibles which are covered with a horny structure.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Premaxilla.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The premaxillæ, or ossa incisiva,
or mandibular structures, are located in the extreme anterior
facial region.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The premaxillæ are long and the anterior end
is pointed. Each consist of two lateral halves which become fused
before the chick is hatched. They partly circumscribe the openings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>into the nose. This bone is the base of the upper portion of the
beak and determines its form. It forms the anterior walls of
the nasal cavity. It has between the nasal bones, two processes
which extend back to the anterior point of the cerebral cavity.
The posterior part of the incisivum and nasale are flat, thin, and
elastic. The extensions then are the <i>processus maxillaris</i>, the
<i>processus palatinus</i>, and the <i>processus frontalis</i>, the first of which
forms part of the jaw rim, the second, which aids in forming the
gum plate, and the last which reaches to the anterior portion of the
cranial wall.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Maxilla.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The superior maxillaries, or ossa maxillares,
two in number, form the floor of the upper beak, a part of
the palatine roof and nasal walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each maxilla borders laterally the premaxilla and the nasal;
inferiorly, the anterior point of the palatine; and posteriorly, the
jugale.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The maxillæ are thin, flat, bones. They have
three borders and three angles. The palatine processes of the two
bones do not meet in the median line, which results in a cleft in
the median palatine region. The bone-like gums are formed partly
by the palatine processes but more largely by lateral wings of the
os incisivum. Each maxilla has posteriorly a yoke-like extension,
superiorly a small extension, and also a palatine process. The
latter articulates by a facet with the vomer.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Nasal.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The nasal bones, or ossa nasalia, two
in number, are located in the lateral facial region. The nasal bone
articulates posteriorly with the frontal; laterally, on the inner
border, with the processus frontalis of the premaxilla, and on the
outer border with the lacrimal; and inferiorly with the premaxilla,
maxilla, jugale, and vomer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The nasal bone, or os nasale, is broad, flat, and
elastic and forms the posterior wall of the nasal opening. Under
this bone is located the infraorbital sinus.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three extensions: first, the <i>processus intermaxillaris</i>,
which forms the upper wall of the nasal cavity; second, the <i>processus
maxillaris anterior</i>, directed downward and forward, which fuses
with the maxillary bone and forms the posterior rim of the nasal
cavity; and third, a <i>posterior processus frontalis</i>, which lies parallel
with the ethmoid.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Lacrimal.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The lacrimal bones, or ossa lacrimalia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>two in number, are located at the outer border and at the junction
of the processus frontalis of the nasal, with the frontal bone.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The lacrimal bone is small, and rather filiform.
They become fused with the nasal and the frontal bones, forming
part of the margin of each.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Palatine.</b>—<i>Location.</i> The palatine bones, or ossa palatina,
two in number, enter into the formation of the inner part of the bony
gum and hard palate, or roof of the mouth. They form the support
for the hard palate. Each palatine articulates posteriorly with
the rostrum, or nasal portion of the sphenoid, and with the pterygoid;
and anteriorly with the maxilla.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The palatine bone is curled posteriorly and is thin
at the upper portion and thick at the lower border. Anteriorly
it has a long rather filiform projection.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Pterygoid.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The pterygoid bones, or ossa pterygoidea,
two in number, are located back of the region of the
posterior nares. They extend diagonally outward and backward
from the median region of the sphenoid rostrum to the quadrate
bone. They articulate anteriorly with the sphenoid rostrum and
the palatine, and posteriorly with the quadrate.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The pterygoid bones are slender and cylindrical,
and are expanded at the ends into an articular facet.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Zygomatic.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The zygomatic, or ossa zygomatica,
two in number are situated below the orbital cavity and extend
from the maxilla to the quadrate bone.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The zygomatic is small, slender, rod-shaped, and
forms the lateral portion of the upper jaw. The anterior portion
of the zygomatic represents the jugal and is fused with the maxilla
and with the anterior processus maxillaris of the nasal bone,
the maxilla, and the posterior portion, the quadrato-jugal, which
articulates with the quadrate bone.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Vomer.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The vomer is located in the median
nasal septum. It articulates with the rostrum of the sphenoid,
being connected to it by a mass of ligaments. It touches anteriorly
the posterior portion of the maxilla.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The vomer is a median bone and aids in the formation
of the septum nasi. It consists of a thin plate, thickest posteriorly
and diminishing toward the anterior edge.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Jugal and Quadrato-jugal.</b>—The jugal and quadrato-jugal
are united forming a long slender cylindrical bone called the zygomatic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>lying at the outer side of the upper jaw. They have been
described under zygomatic, which see.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Quadrate.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The quadrate bones, or ossa quadrata,
two in number, are located antero-laterally to the temporal bones.
Each articulates inferiorly with the posterior articular portion, or
pars articulare, of the inferior maxilla and infero-laterally with
the quadrato-jugalare portion of the zygomatic. It articulates
antero-internally with the pterygoid and supero-posteriorly with
the temporal.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The quadrate bone is anvil-like in shape. It
has an anterior process, the orbital process, for muscular attachments,
and posteriorly it affords attachment to the ear drum.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Inferior Maxilla.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The inferior maxilla, lower jaw,
or os maxillare inferius, also called the mandibular bone, or pars
dentis, is analogous to the lower jaw of mammals. It articulates
posteriorly with the quadrate bone.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The inferior maxilla is the largest bone of the face.
It is made up of a <i>right</i> and a <i>left limb</i> which are separate in the fetus
and which unite subsequently anteriorly, forming the inferior portion
of the beak. Each limb of the jaw is developed from five elements:
the <i>pars articularis</i>, which forms the jaw-joint and, expanded,
articulates with the quadrate bone; the <i>pars angularis</i>, lying just in
front of the pars articularis; the <i>pars supra-angularis</i>, a slender bone
lying just above the angularis; the <i>splenial</i>, a thin plate of bone,
lying along the inner surface of the mandible; and the <i>pars dentalis</i>,
which forms the anterior portion of the jaw.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Turbinate Bones.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The turbinate bones, or ossa
turbinata, six in number, are attached to the lateral walls of the
nasal cavity (Fig. 26, No. A, 1 and 2). In each nasal cavity there are
three turbinate bones, one anterior and two posterior. Of the two
posterior the upper one lies supero-posterior to the inferior one.
The turbinate bones are attached to the lateral nasal walls, project
into the cavity and thus greatly diminishing its extent.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—Each turbinate bone is composed of a very thin
lamina, finely cribriform in many places, and in the fresh state,
covered on both sides with mucous membrane. These bones are
curled and partly membrano-cartilaginous structures which give
greater surface in the nasal passage for mucous membrane in which
the olfactory nerve terminal filaments are distributed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><b>The Nasal Cavity.</b>—The nasal cavity, or cavum nasi, is a longitudinal
passage which extends through the upper part of the face.
It is divided into right and left halves by a median septum nasi.
Its walls are made up of the premaxilla, maxilla, nasal, vomer, and
palatine bones.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Hyoid Bone.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The hyoid bone, or os hyoideum,
is situated chiefly between the rami of the mandible, but its upper
part extends around the outer margin of the base of the skull. The
hyoid bone does not articulate with any bones of the skull, but is
firmly attached by strong fibrous structure.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The hyoid bone consists of the following parts:
the <i>body</i>, or <i>basi-hyal</i>, which is subcylindrical and presents in front
a trochlear articular surface, convex transversely, and concave
vertically for articulation with the ewer-shaped portion of the glosso-hyal.
The anterior free portion, or lingual process, is called the
<i>glosso-hyal</i>, or <i>entoglossal bone</i>. The lingual process gives support
to the muscular and fibrous structures of the tongue. On either
side of the basi-hyal there is a limb passing posteriorly along the
side of the superior larynx, extending upward along the outer border
of the occipital bone. This is the <i>cornu</i> of the os hyoideum and is
divided into two elements, first, the <i>basi-branchial</i> which is bone and
articulates with the basi-hyal, and the second, the <i>cerato-branchial</i>,
cartilaginous in structure. In the center and projecting backward
from the body of the os hyoideum is a spur process called the <i>uro-hyal</i>,
partly bony and partly cartilaginous, and which rests upon
the superior larynx.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN</h4>

<p class='c015'>The vertebral, or spinal column consists of 42 bones, as shown in
the following table:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><i>Description.</i>—The long cervical section of the spinal column is
S-shaped and is made up of fourteen vertebræ. The anterior segments
move freely forward, the middle ones backward and the posterior
ones forward, allowing the S-shaped curve of the neck. The
neck is flexible so that it is possible for the beak to reach the coccygeal
oil gland. The bird is enabled to reach the feathers on all parts
of the body to cleanse and oil them.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Atlas.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The first cervical vertebra is called the
atlas. Anteriorly it articulates with the single condyle of the occipital
bone. Posteriorly it articulates with the axis, or second
cervical vertebra.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The atlas is the smallest of the cervical vertebræ
and is ring-shaped. The anterior articular surface, half-moon
in shape, forms a deep articular cavity. The joint, called a ball-and-socket
joint, makes possible movements in all directions. The
condyle of the occiput also touches an articular end of the odontoid
process of the axis, or second cervical vertebra. Posteriorly there
projects from the atlas two small lateral wings possessing articular
facets which articulate with similar facets on the lateral wings of
the axis. Posteriorly the body of the atlas is also provided with an
articular surface which articulates with a similar surface on the
anterior portion of the body of the axis.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Axis.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The axis is the second cervical vertebra.
It articulates anteriorly with the atlas, and by a facet on the extreme
anterior end of the odontoid process, with the condyle of the occipital
bone. Posteriorly it articulates with the third cervical
vertebra.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The body of the axis is short. The upper anterior
portion of the body of the axis is provided with a tooth-like process
called the <i>odontoid process</i>. There are two anterior lateral wings
provided with small articular facets which articulate with similar
facets of the atlas. The anterior surface of the body of the axis
forms a true articulation with the body of the atlas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The axis is provided with a <i>superior</i> and an <i>inferior spine</i>. There
are two posterior articular processes which articulate with the
prezygapophyses, or anterior articular processes, of the third cervical
vertebra. The posterior part of the body of the axis forms a true
articulation with the body of the third cervical vertebra.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Other Cervical Vertebræ.</b>—Beginning with the axis, the body
of which is relatively short, the body of each succeeding vertebra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>is longer than that of the preceding. The articulations of each
vertebra with adjoining vertebræ are effected by means of diarthrodial
facets, convex in one direction and concave in the other.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Between the bodies of the vertebræ are pads of fibrous cartilage.
Above these bodies and inferior to the neural spines extends throughout
the spinal column the large <i>neural canal</i> which is occupied by
the spinal cord. Between the vertebral segments the neural canal
is exposed superiorly, since here the neural arches do not completely
bridge the canal. These spaces are protected by intervertebral
ligaments.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the superior neural spines and the inferior spines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>from the body of the vertebra project <i>lateral processes</i>, and anterior
and posterior <i>oblique processes</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>All cervical vertebræ except the atlas and the axis are made up of
the following parts: a body, or centrum, a neural canal, a neural
arch, a superior dorsal, or neural spine, or neurapophysis, which
in most cervical vertebræ is only slightly developed, two oblique
processes, or zygapophyses, two transverse processes, or diapophyses
(Fig. 10, No. 12) and in some vertebræ two tubercles, or anapophyses
above the posterior zygapophyses. The <i>prezygapophyses</i> are
directed upward and inward; the <i>postzygapophyses</i> are directed
downward and outward. The inferior spines are only well developed
in the last two or three cervical vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between vertebral segments, except the central sacral portion, on
each side, there is an <i>intervertebral foramen</i> (Fig. 11, No. <i>A</i>, 4),
through which pass the spinal nerves. In the central portion of the
sacrum where the vertebræ have fused, there are two foramina on
each side for each original vertebra, one located above the other,
the upper giving passage to the sensory branch, the lower to the
motor branch of the nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Dorsal Vertebræ</b> (Fig. 4, No. 23; Fig. 11, <i>A</i>). <i>Location.</i>—The
dorsal, or thoracic vertebræ, or vertebræ thoracicales, aid in
forming the roof of the chest cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The dorsal vertebral section is made up of seven
vertebræ, with strong short bodies. The first and sixth dorsal
segments articulate as do the cervical, by the bodies and oblique
processes. (Fig. 11, No. <i>A</i>, 3, illustrates the oblique processes.)
The seventh dorsal is fused with the first lumbo-sacral vertebra.
The second to the fifth inclusive of the vertebræ are fused together,
and the superior and inferior spinous processes are fused into a
prominent plate-like ridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transverse processes of the dorsal vertebræ, from the second to
the sixth, are well developed and are bridged over with a thin layer of
bone. The ventral spines are partly fused and form a very prominent
and continuous ridge. (Fig. 11, No. <i>A</i>, 1, shows the fused
superior spines; No. 2, the fused inferior spines; and No. 4, the intervertebral
foramina.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Lumbo-sacral Vertebræ</b> (Fig. 5, Part II, No. 4). <i>Location.</i>—The

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><i>Description.</i>—The lumbo-sacral region consists of fourteen vertebræ
which are distinct in the body of the newly hatched chick, but
which become fused soon after hatching. With these vertebral
segments there are fused the last dorsal and first coccygeal vertebral
segments. This fusion is so complete that the segments are indicated
only by the intervertebral foramina on the sides through
which the spinal nerves pass, and by transverse markings on the
inferior surface of the bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lumbo-sacral vertebræ, called the sacrum, and the ilia are
fused. The dorsal spines of the vertebral segments are indicated
only in the anterior portion where they are fused, forming a plate.
There are no prominent ventral spines.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Coccygeal Vertebræ</b> (Fig. 4, No. 27). <i>Location.</i>—The
coccygeal or caudal vertebræ, or vertebræ coccygeæ, constitute the
bones of the tail.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—There are seven coccygeal vertebræ. The last
segment, shaped like a plough share and therefore called the pygostyle,
is the largest and is supposed to have been formed by the
fusion of several original distinct segments. It supports the coccygeal
oil gland and the row of rudder feathers, or rectrices, which
are arranged fan-wise.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of the coccygeal vertebræ except the first are freely movable,
thus allowing the tail to be used as a rudder during flight. The
lateral spines are long and well developed, and the superior
spines are bifurcated, thus giving increased surface for muscular
attachment. The first coccygeal segment is fused with the last
lumbo-sacral vertebra.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE THORAX</h4>

<p class='c015'>The dorsal vertebræ superiorly, the ribs laterally, and the sternum,
or breast-bone inferiorly, form the skeleton of a large cavity called
the thorax. The dorsal vertebræ have been described.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Ribs</b> (Fig. 4, No. 32; Fig. 10, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). <i>Location.</i>—The
ribs form the lateral bony wall of the thorax, articulating superiorly
with the dorsal vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The ribs are arranged in order of length, the ultimate
rib being the longest. From anterior to posterior, they approach
more nearly a horizontal position. The ribs are divided into the
true and the false. The <i>true ribs</i> articulate with the sternum. The
<i>false ribs</i> do not touch the sternum; they are floating. The true
ribs are composed of two parts, a vertebral, or dorsal, and a sternal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>or ventral. The vertebral part, or <i>extremitas vertebralis</i>, is provided
with an articular head, or <i>caput costæ</i>; a neck, or <i>collum costæ</i>;
and an articular tubercle, or <i>tuberculum costæ</i>. The head and
tubercle articulate with the dorsal vertebra. Below the head of
each rib is a <i>pneumatic foramen</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal extremity of the dorsal section of the rib articulates
with the proximal end of the sternal section by a diarthrodial
articulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The articulations of the true ribs with the sternum is diarthrodial
and each articulate by two small ridges with a double sternal facet.
The first, the second, and the seventh ribs are floating, or false
ribs. The first rib articulates with the quadrate part of the last
cervical vertebra and also with the first dorsal vertebra. The
seventh, the last rib, articulates with the under side of the anterior
alar part of the ilium. This rib is situated similarly to the true ribs;
but, instead of articulating directly with the sternum, the lower end
lies against the sternal segment of the rib just anterior to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the posterior edge of the second, the third, the fourth, and
the fifth ribs, and near the middle of the dorsal segment, are flat,
uncinate, bony processes which project upward and backward, overlying
in each case, the succeeding rib and giving greater surface for
muscular attachments and greater stability to the thorax.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Sternum</b> (Fig. 4, No. 40; Fig. 10, No. <i>A</i>, 9). <i>Location.</i>—The
sternum, or breast-bone forms the inferior portion, or floor of the
thoracic cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The sternum is a quadrilateral, curved plate with
processes projecting from each angle and from the middle of the
anterior and posterior borders. The posterior medial projection,
or <i>metasternum</i>, is the longest, and has a tall, plate-like ridge—the
<i>sternal crest</i>, <i>crista sterni</i>—running along its ventral surface.
The crest serves the important function of increasing the bony area
for the attachment of the powerful muscles which move the wings.
The anterior medial projection, or <i>rostrum</i>, is short, and pierced
at its root by an opening from which extend two elongated, saddle-shaped
depressions into which the end of the coracoid bones are
received.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plate-like process of bone, the <i>posterior lateral process</i>, which
projects from the caudal angles of the sternum soon divides into two
parts. The shorter of these, the <i>oblique process</i>, broadens toward its
free end and covers the sternal segments of the last two ribs. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>sides of the sternum are thus provided with an external and an internal
process forming an <i>external</i> and an <i>internal</i> notch. These
notches are bridged over by a broad ligament, to which the muscles
are attached. In poor flyers, as the domestic fowl, these notches
are large. The posterior end of the sternum is called the <i>xiphoid
process</i> or <i>processus xiphoideus</i>. Anteriorly the sternum is provided
with lateral external processes, the <i>costal processes</i>. The lateral
borders of the sternum are pitted by four depressions into which
the sternal segments of the ribs are received. The dorsal, or inner
surface of the bone is pierced by openings by which the air-sacs
communicate with the interior.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>The Appendicular Skeleton</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The appendicular skeleton consists of the shoulder girdle, the fore
limb, the pelvic girdle, or hip bone, and the hind limb. The shoulder
girdle consists of the scapula, the coracoid, and the clavicle. The fore
limb consists of the arm, forearm, and the hand. The arm consists
of the humerus, the forearm of the radius and the ulna; and the hand
consists of the carpus, the metacarpus, and the phalanges. The
pelvic girdle consists of the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis. The
hind limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The thigh
consists of the femur, and the leg consists of the tibia and the fibula.
The foot consists of the metatarsus and the phalanges.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE SHOULDER GIRDLE</h4>

<p class='c015'>The shoulder girdle consists of the scapula, the clavicle and the
coracoid.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Scapula.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The scapula (Fig. 11, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>) lies on the
outer and superior rib surface, extending parallel with the dorsal
vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The scapula is a thin, sword-like bone, becoming
thicker as it approaches the shoulder-joint. The scapula expands
and becomes thin near the free end, which reaches nearly to the
antero-lateral portion of the ilium (Fig. 4, No. 24). The scapula
articulates with the coracoid. A <i>pneumatic foramen</i> is located at
the base of the acromion process. The anterior part of the scapula
is provided with an articular head and is provided with an inner
process, called the <i>processus furcularis</i>, which lies near the furcula
and coracoid. An outer stronger <i>processus humeralis</i> forms the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>posterior half of the <i>glenoid cavity</i>, or <i>cavitas glenoidalis</i>, in which
the humerus articulates and the processus coracoideus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Clavicle.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The clavicles, commonly known as the
wish bone, are located in the anterior chest region.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The clavicles are long, slender bones uniting below
in the <i>hypocledium</i>, a laterally flattened process. They are joined
to the upper end of the coracoid by fibrous cartilage. The hypocledium
is joined to the anterior point of the sternum by the claviculosternal
ligament. The clavicles, as united by the hypocledium,
form a v-shaped structure called the furculum, or, popularly, the
wish bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The forks play the part of an elastic spring, whose office it is to
prevent the wings from coming toward each other during contraction
of the depressor muscles. The conformation of this bone is, therefore,
like the sternum, related to the extent and power of flight;
and for this reason it is that, in swift flyers, the two branches of the
furculum are thick, solid, widely separated, and curved like a U;
while in those that fly heavily and with difficulty, these branches are
thin and weak, and join at an acute angle. The latter formation
greatly diminishes its strength, and lessens, in a singular manner,
the reactionary power of the bony arch it represents.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Coracoid.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The coracoid is located just back of
the clavicle and at the side of the entrance of the thoracic cavity.
It is the strongest bone of the shoulder girdle, extending upward,
outward, and forward. It articulates inferiorly with the sternum
and superiorly with the humerus and the scapula, and is attached
to the superior end of the furcular limb by a fibrous cartilage.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—It is thinnest in the center or shaft and broadens
toward the inferior extremity. The upper hook-like part of the
coracoid forms the fore part of the glenoid cavity, and together with
the scapula and furcula form the foramen triosseum through which
passes the tendon of the elevator muscle of the wing. The upper
end flattens out into three tuberosities, the tuberositas furcularis
which is thick and to which attaches the limb of the furcula, the
tuberositas scapularis which unites to the scapula, and the tuberositas
humeralis which lies between these and articulates with the
humerus.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE FORE LIMB</h4>

<p class='c015'>The bones of the fore limb are humerus, ulna, radius, carpus,
metacarpus, and phalanges.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><b>The Humerus.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The humerus constitutes the arm,
which, when at rest, lies parallel to the dorsal vertebræ. It articulates
superiorly with the glenoid cavity, a shallow ball-and-socket
joint, formed by the scapula and the coracoid; and inferiorly with
the ulna and radius.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The proximal extremity of the humerus is provided
with a trochanter (Fig. 11, <i>G</i>, No. 5) and a large oval head or caput
humeri, which articulates in the glenoid cavity. The head is an
elongate, semi-oval convexity, with the long axis transverse from the
radial to the ulnar side and with the ends continued into upper and
lower crests. The upper crest of the head of the humerus is on the
radial side and the lower crest on the under side. Under this latter
crest there is a <i>pneumatic fossa</i> (Fig. 11, <i>F</i>, No. 1), at the upper end of
which there is an opening into the bone, the <i>pneumatic foramen</i>,
which brings the air-sac into communication with the air space
of the bone. The shaft, or corpus humeris, is irregularly cylindrical
and slightly S-shaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proximal part of the shaft, which is expanded on the
palmar side, is concave across and convex lengthwise. The distal
part is slightly flattened. The shaft of the humerus is almost
cylindrical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal extremity of the humerus is provided with two articular
condyles, one of which articulates with the ulna and the other
with the radius. On the radial side of the palmar surface there is
a ridge; and on the ulnar side of the same surface there is a second
ridge diverging to the opposite tuberosity. The radial surface is
a narrow, subelongate convexity, extending from the middle, approximately,
of the palmar surface, obliquely to the lower part of the
radial tuberosity. The two <i>articular convexities</i>, or <i>trochlea</i>, at the
distal end of the humerus are bent toward the palmar aspect, the
<i>anconal aspect</i> is the side on which the elbow is situated. The inner
convexity is the larger and articulates with the ulna. To the outside
is the <i>processus cubitalis humeri</i>. The outer articulates with the
radius and is so arranged that the radius makes a greater flexion than
the ulna. At the lower end of the humerus there is a depression
which receives the anconeus of the ulna during flexion and extension
of the forearm. On the shoulder- and elbow-joint are found grooves
over which the tendons glide, at which places sheaths are provided.
This arrangement also aids in keeping the capsular ligament in
place.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><b>The Ulna.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The ulna, larger than the radius, is bent
and articulates with the radius only at the ends. The two bones
are bound together by a ligamentous band. It also articulates
superiorly with the distal end of the humerus, and inferiorly with
the carpus. When the wing is folded the radius is superior and a
trifle to the inner side of the ulna.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The proximal end is most expanded, and is obliquely
truncate for the articular excavation adapted to the ulnar tubercle
of the humerus. A short angular process behind the cavity represents
the <i>olecranon</i>, which is the <i>processus olecranalis coracoideus
ulnæ</i> to which the ligamentum capsulare cubiti attaches. On the
inner side of the head is the internal tubercle of the ulna and on the
external side the external tubercle of the ulna. An excavation is
noted on the radial side of the proximal end for the lateral articulation
of the head of the radius. On the upper side near the articular
part is located the <i>sigmoid cavity</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shaft, or corpus ulnæ, decreases in size near the distal end.
It is slightly curved, flattened laterally with an internal and an external
ridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal end of the ulna is slightly expanded into a <i>trochlea</i>
which is sharply convex and articulates with two free carpal bones,
the scapho-lunar, or os carpi radiale, and the cuneiform, or os carpi
ulnare. The scapho-lunar is placed on the radial side, and the carpiulnare
on the ulnar side. The distal extremity of the ulna is provided
with a <i>styloid process</i> and on the dorsal side with a <i>tubercle</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Radius.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The radius lies beside the ulna with
which it articulates at each extremity. At the inferior extremity the
articulation is rotary. It also articulates superiorly with the humerus
and inferiorly with the os carpi radiale.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The radius, cylindrical in shape, is more slender
than the ulna.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proximal end is expanded, subelliptical, with a concavity
for the oblique tubercle and a thickened convex border for articulation
with the ulna. This end is provided with the <i>tuberositas
radii</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shaft, or corpus radii, is slender, subcompressed, and has a
slight bend upward from the ulna. A nutrient foramen occurs in
this shaft.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal end is expanded and rather flattened with two grooves
on the anconal side for passage of tendons. For articulation with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the scapho-lunar the radius is provided with a terminal <i>transverse
convexity</i> produced palmad, which also articulates with the ulna
laterally. There is a tuberosity on the radial side of the expansion
and inferiorly the <i>inferior tuberculum ossis carpi radialis</i> and superiorly
a <i>superior tuberculum ossis carpi radialis</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Hand.</b>—The hand is made up of the carpus, the metacarpus,
and the phalanges.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bones of the hand are so arranged as to allow abduction and
adduction, or flexion in the ulno-radial plane, movements which are
necessary in the outspreading and folding of the wing. Thus the
hand of the fowl moves in a state of pronation, without the power of
rotation. The carpal bones are so placed between the anterior arm
and metacarpus as to reduce the abduction which is necessary to
hold and extend the wing, so that the hand or wing be in a fixed
position.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Carpus.</b>—The carpus in the domestic fowl is represented by
two bones, ossa carpi, called the <i>scapho-lunar</i>, or <i>os carpi radiale</i>,
and the <i>cuneiform</i>, or <i>os carpi ulnare</i>. The scapho-lunar is the
smaller and is located between the radius and metacarpus. The
cuneiform is the larger and is located between the ulna, the radius,
and the metacarpus. The cuneiform is somewhat anvil-like in
shape, being provided with a body and two prongs.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Metacarpus.</b>—The metacarpal bones, or ossa metacarpi,
two in number, are separated at their middle portion, and consolidated
at their extremities. The upper proximal base of the metacarpus
is provided with a tubercle, the tuberculum muscularis, and
externally the tuberculum ulnare ossis metacarpi. The distal end
of the metacarpal bone is provided with a tuberculum articulare.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Phalanges.</b>—The first three fingers only are represented, and
these are rudimentary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first finger called the pollex or thumb, consists of but one
joint. It is located on the proximal and outer end of the metacarpal
bone. It has on its proximal end a tubercle, the tuberculum
articulare.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second finger, the best developed, consists of two phalanxes.
These are the main bones extending from the metacarpus. Each
articular end is provided with a <i>tuberculum articulare</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third finger, small, cylindrical in shape, is located at the
distal and inner side of the metacarpal bone.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><b>THE PELVIC GIRDLE</b> (Fig. 4, No. 25; Fig. 5, Part II, 6)</p>

<p class='c007'>The pelvic girdle is made up of three bones as follows: the ilium,
the ischium, and the pubis, all of which are fused in adult life.
They are separate in the baby chick (Fig. 5, Part II, 6). The pelvis
together with the lumbo-sacral vertebræ forms a thin, irregular,
shell-like structure extending superiorly from the tail to the thoracic
region. The sacrum is broad posteriorly and together with the
ilium forms the pelvic roof. The ilium and ischium are its lateral
walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The top surface of the pelvis shows the <i>fovea ilio-lumbalis dorsalis</i>,
which is bounded mesially by the crista ilii. Between it and the
spina lumbalis there is a broad furrow, the bottom of which is formed
by the dorsal surface of the lumbar vertebræ. The <i>sulcus ilio-lumbalis
dorsalis</i> is formed by the rims of the ilia, so that a ridge is
observable. The <i>cavum ilio-lumbale dorsale</i> is formed by the iliac
rims on either side. Anteriorly is the <i>canalis ilio-lumbalis</i>, which is
formed by the ilium and the lumbar vertebral spines. It is located
longitudinally to the vertebræ. The anterior opening of this canal
is the larger. Posterior to the <i>acetabulum</i> is the <i>post-acetabular</i>
ridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The under part of the pelvis presents three distinct regions.
The cavity is divided into the <i>fovea lumbalis</i>, or anterior part,
the <i>fovea ischiadica</i>, or mesial part, and the <i>fovea pudendalis</i>, or
posterior part. Posterior to these is the region called the <i>planum
coccygeum</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fovea lumbalis contains the anterior lobe of the kidney,
and is circumscribed anteriorly by the last rib-carrying vertebra,
and posteriorly by the transverse process of the last lumbar
vertebra.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fovea ischiadica which follows, lie the nerve plexus
ischiadicus and the middle lobe of the kidney. Its posterior
boundary is the linea arcuata. The linea arcuata is a line drawn
from the acetabulum of the one side to the acetabulum of the other
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fovea pudendalis contains the posterior lobe of the kidney.
The posterior boundary is the anterior border of the first coccygeal
vertebra. It gives passage to the nerve plexus pudendo-hemorrhoidalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ilium, the ischium, and the pubis join to form the cotyloid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>cavity, or acetabulum, in which articulates the head of the femur.
The floor of the cavity is perforated by a relatively large round
foramen.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Ilium.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The ilium, together with the lumbo-sacral
vertebræ, forms the roof of the pelvic cavity. It articulates at its
inner border with the lumbo-sacral vertebræ, postero-laterally with
the ischium and at the cotyloid cavity with the pubis.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The ilium is remarkable for its development
in the long axis of the vertebral column. It is long and
narrow; and mesially, where it is thickest it forms the upper wall
of the acetabulum. Anterior to the acetabulum it is outwardly
concave, and posterior to the acetabulum it is convex. The ilium
fuses with the last dorsal vertebra and with the lumbo-sacral
vertebræ and is excavated on its internal face. This surface is
irregular and lodges the kidneys. This inner margin of the renal
part enters with the square extensions of the posterior excavation
passing into the posterior iliac spine. The external margin is the
extension of the crista transversa and forms the <i>processus ischiadicus</i>.
Posteriorward the renal part of the ilium joins the ischium.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ilia converge at the summits of the anterior sacral spines
forming the <i>ilio-lumbar</i> spines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ilium is joined to the square extensions of the last sacral
vertebra by the <i>symphysis ilio-sacralis</i>, to the larger part of the
lumbar vertebræ by the <i>sutura ilio-lumbalis</i>, and to the transverse
processes of the last sacral vertebræ by the <i>symphysis ilio-sacri</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Ischium.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The ischium is located in the postero-inferior
part of the pelvis. It joins superiorly with the ilium, and
inferiorly with the pubis.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The ischium is smaller than the ilium and is a
flattened, triangular-shaped bone, thickest where it forms the
posterior part of the acetabulum, becoming thinner and broader as
it extends backward. Posteriorly it forms the caudal extension.
The inferior border is turned slightly outward and is fused with the
pubis. Between these bones there is located the large oval <i>ischiadic
foramen</i>, through which passes the ischiadic nerve. This bone aids
the ilium in the formation of the obturator foramen through which
passes the tendon of the internal obturator muscle. The lower
part of the ischium which separates the ischiadic foramen from the
obturator foramen is called the <i>ramus ascendens ossis ischii</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><b>The Pubis.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The pubis is located along the inferior
margin of the ischium and extends further back than the posterior
border of the ischium.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The pubis is a long, slender, rib-like bone. It
forms the lower and front portion of the acetabulum. The ischiadic
foramen formed by the ischium and pubis is single and nearly
circular in fowls, double in pigeons, and in geese and ducks it is
elongate.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE HIND LIMB (Fig. 4, Nos. 35, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, and 53; Fig. 12)</h3>

<p class='c015'>The pelvic, or hind, limb supports the body. The bones of
each leg are the femur, which constitutes the thigh, the tibia and
the fibula, which represents the leg, and the metatarsus and the
phalanges, which form the foot.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Femur</b> (Fig. 12, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). <i>Location.</i>—The femur, or os
femoris, the first bone of the hind extremity, extends obliquely
downward and forward, articulating with the acetabulum above
and the tibia, the fibula, and the patella below.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The femur, one of the largest, thickest, and strongest
bones of the body, belongs to the class of cylindrical bones,
and presents for examination a shaft and two extremities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superior, or proximal extremity, is provided with a head,
caput femoris; the neck, collum femoris; and the trochanter. The
head is relatively small, and is marked by a depression above for the
round ligament which fills the cavity in the acetabular wall. Its
axis is nearly at right angles with the shaft. A neck joins it to the
body at the proximal end. External to the head of the femur is
the <i>trochanter</i>. The trochanter presents an outer convexity over
which the tendon of the gluteus maximus extends to become inserted
below. The <i>trochanteric ridge</i>, which is opposite the articular
head, presents an outer flattened surface which possesses impressions
for muscular attachments. The <i>trochanteric fossa</i>, or fossa trochanterica,
is shallow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>shaft</i>, or <i>corpus femoris</i>, is shorter than the tibia, is in general
cylindrical, bent forward, and the lower half is flattened and expanded
transversely. A nutrient foramen is located in the median
portion of the shaft. The shaft shows muscular linear ridges.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal extremity is large in both directions and comprises the
<i>trochlea</i> in front and two <i>condyles</i> behind, one internal and one external.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The condyles are separated by the <i>intercondyloid fossa</i>, or
<i>fossa intercondyloidea</i>, which is marked with pits for the attachment
of ligaments; and above this is the <i>epitrochlear fossa</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>inner condyle</i> begins anteriorly as a ridge, and expands into
a convexity which attains its greatest breadth posteriorly where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>becomes more flattened. The inner side of the inner condyle is
flattened and is provided with a tuberosity at its mid-part and a
second just above the posterior part of the condyle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>outer condyle</i> is formed in the same manner as the inner condyle.
It is indented at its broad, lower end by an <i>angular groove</i>,
which, winding divides the posterior part of the condyle into two
convexities. The more external convex ridge and the groove dividing
it from the outer condyle are adapted to the head of the fibula.
There is in this part a <i>fibular ridge</i> and above this ridge a tuberosity.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Tibia.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The tibia (Fig. 12, <i>D</i> and <i>C</i>) extends obliquely
downward and backward from the knee-joint to the hock.
It articulates above with the femur and, by its procnemial process
with the patella, below with the metatarsus, and laterally with the
fibula.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The tibia is the longest bone in the posterior limb,
and possesses a shaft and two extremities. It is largest at the proximal
end and presents three faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proximal extremity presents a semi-oval articular surface,
not quite at right angles with the shaft, which articulates with the
condyles of the femur. The margin is raised toward the anterior
of the bone. The <i>head of the tibia</i>, or <i>caput tibiæ</i>, extends into a
rotular process which extends transversely, and is truncate. From
the anterior of this process there descends two vertical ridges; one
near the angle of the rotular process, the <i>procnemial ridge</i>; the other
from the outer fibular angle, the <i>ectocnemial ridge</i>. On the outer side
of the intercondylar tuberosity there is a surface for the ligamentous
union with the head of the fibula; and a short distance below this
there is a vertical ridge for the close attachment, almost a fusion,
with the fibula, called the <i>fibular ridge</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>shaft</i>, or <i>corpus tibiæ</i> is straight and the upper two-thirds
subtrihedral; the lower third oval. A <i>nutrient foramen</i> occurs near
the upper postero-internal portion of the middle third of the
bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal extremity is much smaller than the proximal one;
it is quadrangular in form. The expanded inferior end of the tibia
forms two articular condyles above which posteriorly there is the
<i>epicondyloid fossa</i>. The inner condyle, the larger, has a groove near
the lower end of the anterior part of the shaft, which deepens toward
the intercondyloid space. This <i>intercondyloid fossa</i> in young
birds is covered by a strong ligament, which in older birds, becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>ossified. On the lateral side of each condyle, there is a depression
for the attachment of ligaments.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Patella.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The patella, or knee-cap, thin and wide,
articulates with the procnemial process of the tibia, and with the
deep trochlea of the distal end of the femur.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The patella is irregular in shape with three faces
and three borders. The posterior surface is articular. The other
two surfaces are rough for tendinous attachment. The patellar
ligaments in old birds may become ossified.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to turn the foot in and out, the tibia not only turns
around the inner condyle of the femur, but also around the patella,
so that the posterior surface turns outward and thus turns outward
the metatarsus and all the toes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Fibula.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The fibula lies at the outer border of the
tibia. It articulates superiorly with the outer condyle of the femur,
and laterally with the tibia.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The fibula is rudimentary; it is largest superiorly and
tapers to a slender point. The head is compressed laterally, and furnishes
an upper and an inner articular surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Tarsus.</b>—There exist, during fetal development of the chick,
two rows of tarsal bones which later become fused. The upper
row fuses with the tibia and the lower with the metatarsus. Therefore,
in the adult, there is no tarsus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Metatarsus.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The metatarsal bone extends downward
and forward. In birds it consists of one bone, which articulates
superiorly with the inferior extremity of the tibia. On the
distal end it has a threefold trochlear arrangement which articulates
with the three principal digits.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The proximal extremity posteriorly has a process
which may be considered as a consolidation of originally separate
metatarsal bones. The process at the supero-posterior part of
the metatarsus is called the <i>hypotarsus</i> of the <i>tarso-metatarsus</i>,
through which extends a canal called the <i>hypotarsal canal</i>, and which
gives passage to flexor tendons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proximal end of the metatarsus is ossified from one center of
ossification forming an epiphysis which caps the ends of the three
original metatarsal bones that coalesce, first with one another, then
with the epiphysis, thus forming a single compound bone. Above
and just to the inside of the metatarsus there may occur a small
bone which is imbedded in ligaments and articulates with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>inner proximal surface of the metatarsus. This has been called
by Gadow a <i>sesamoid bone</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shaft shows <i>tendonal grooves</i> which are best marked on the
posterior surface. The shaft is rounded at the sides and flattened
on the anterior and posterior surfaces. At the juncture of the
middle and inferior thirds of the metatarsus there is a conical process
turned slightly backward, which serves as a base for the <i>spur</i>. The
spur is a horny structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the distal extremity occurs the threefold trochlear arrangement
mentioned above, which incloses the fossa intercondyloidea. The
inner trochlea is the broadest, and the outer the narrowest. The
inner trochlea articulates with the proximal end of the second, the
middle with the third, and the outer with the fourth toe.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Phalanges.</b> <i>Location.</i>—Most domestic fowls are provided
with four digits, or toes; the Houdan and Dorking are provided with
five. In fowls with four toes the three principal toes, the second, the
third, and the fourth, are directed forward, and the first, or hallux,
is directed backward.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Description.</i>—The last phalanx of each toe, called the ungual
phalanx, is slightly curved downward, is pointed anteriorly, like
the claw of the cat or dog, and is covered with a horny sheath. The
articular ends of the joints of the phalanges are enlarged. The base
of the basal phalanx has two enlargements, the superior-inferior
tubercles, or tuberculum superius et inferius, between which is located
the fossa articularis transversa. Laterally the head has two
condyles, condyli laterales, which are divided by the sulcus longitudinalis.
The bodies of the phalanges vary in form; they are superiorly
rounded, but inferiorly rounded, flat, or even somewhat concave.
The distal extremity has an articular trochlea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>first toe</i>, or digit, called the <i>great toe</i>, or <i>hallux</i>, is composed
of three phalanges, or segments. The first segment, or basal
phalanx is considered a rudimentary metacarpal bone; it is attached
by a fibrous cartilaginous tissue to the inner posterior
surface of the inferior extremity of the metacarpal bone just below
the spur.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>second toe</i>, likewise composed of three phalanges, is directed
forward. It articulates with the inner trochlea located on the
inferior metacarpal bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>third toe</i>, made up of four phalanges, is the middle of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>three forward toes. It articulates with the middle trochlea of the
inferior extremity of the metacarpal bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>fourth toe</i>, is composed of five phalanges; it is, however,
of approximately the same length as the third, the segments being
shorter. The fourth or outer toe articulates with the outer trochlea
of the distal extremity of the metacarpal bone.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ARTHROLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>Kinds of Joints.</b>—Joints may be movable, immovable, or mixed.
In <i>movable</i>, or <i>true joints</i> the articular surface of each bone is covered
by cartilage. The bones are held together by ligaments, the
capsular one often surrounding the joint and enclosing the synovial
membrane. In some joints there is a pad of fibrous cartilage
interposed between the two articular cartilages. Such a pad,
called a <i>meniscus</i>, adds to the elasticity and the free movement
of the joint. Movable joints form the most numerous class; they
are for the most part found in the limbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an <i>immovable joint</i> there is only a thin layer of fibrous or
cartilaginous material interposed between the bones. The fibrous
layer of the periosteum of both bones unite to cover the connecting
material and becomes attached to the same, thus serving as a ligament.
If the connecting material is fibrous, the joint is called a
<i>suture</i>; if cartilaginous, a <i>synchondrosis</i>. These joints are found
in the skull and in the pelvis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term <i>mixed</i> is used with reference, not to the motion in joints,
but to their structure, which partakes of the nature of both the
movable and immovable. The bones are firmly joined by a strong
interposed pad of fibrous cartilage to which also is adherent the
ligaments of the joint. There are no capsular ligaments; the
cartilaginous pad or disc is softer toward its center, where occasionally
there may be one, or even two, narrow cavities. Authorities
differ as to whether such cavities are lined by synovial membrane
or not. Since there are really no frictional surfaces in such a joint,
motion depends upon the flexibility of the disc. The joints between
the vertebral centra afford the best illustration of the mixed class.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Movement of Joints.</b>—The movements admissible in joints may
be divided into four kinds: gliding, angular movement, circumduction,
and rotation. These movements are often, however, more or
less combined in the various joints. It is seldom that there occurs
only one kind of motion in any particular joint.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Gliding movement</i> is the most simple kind of motion that can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>take place in a joint, one surface gliding or moving over another
without any angular or rotary movement.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angular movement</i> occurs only between the long bones. By
it the angle between the two bones is increased or diminished. It
may take place in four directions: forward and backward, consisting
of flexion and extension; or inward and outward from the medial
line of the body, consisting of adduction and abduction. Abduction
of a limb is movement away from the medial line of the body.
Adduction of a limb is movement toward the medial line of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Circumduction</i> is that limited degree of motion which takes
place between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, whilst
the extremity and sides of the limb are made to circumscribe a
conical space, the base of which corresponds with the inferior
extremity of the limb, the apex with the articular cavity; this
kind of motion is best seen in the shoulder- and hip-joint.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rotation</i> is the movement of a bone upon an axis, which is the
axis of the pivot on which the bone turns, as in the articulation
between the atlas and axis, when the odontoid process serves as a
pivot around which the atlas turns; or else is the axis of a pivotlike
process which turns within a ring, as in the rotation of the radius
upon the humerus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Pronation</i> is a form of rotation in which the inferior extremity
of the radius passes before the ulna, and thus causes the hand to
execute a kind of rotation from without inward.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Supination</i> is a form of rotation in which the movement of the
forearm and hand are carried outward so that the anterior surface
of the latter becomes superior.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Ligamentous Structure.</b>—Ligaments are dense, fibrous, connecting
structures. They are made up principally of white fibrous
tissue and exist in all true joints.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are four kinds of ligaments associated with true joints:</p>

<p class='c007'>The first kind, the <i>capsular ligament</i> which encloses all true
joints, is thin and consists of interlaced fibers attached to the bone
at the edges of the articular cartilages. It either partly or wholly
surrounds the joint, enclosing and protecting a synovial apparatus,
which, by secreting a liquid resembling serum, lubricates the joint
to prevent friction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second kind, the binding or <i>lateral ligaments</i>, consist of
flattened or rounded cords or bands of fibrous tissue. Such a
ligament extends from one bone to the other, and firmly attached to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>their roughened surfaces, holds the bones in place and at the same
time allows the required amount of motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third kind, located between the joints, is called <i>interosseous
ligament</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth kind, called the <i>annular ligament</i> binds down and
protects the tendons.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Ear<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</b>—The concha of the ear is provided with
a superior and an inferior ligament.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The classification of Gadow is used.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Jaw.</b>—The articulations of the lower jaw are
complex. The freely movable articulation is between the inferior
maxilla and the quadrate. Less freely movable articulations are
formed by the quadrate with the temporal, the zygomatic and the
pterygoid. A lateral ligament of the jaw, the <i>articulo-jugale</i> extends
from the posterior border of the inner wing of the os articulare
of the inferior maxilla (Fig. 8, No. 10, and Fig. 19, No. 15) to the
outer border of the os quadrato jugulare.</p>

<p class='c007'>A <i>lateral temporo-maxillary ligament</i> extends from the outer surface
of the temporal bone to the outer border of the os articulare
of the inferior maxilla (Fig. 8, No. 11, and Fig. 19, No. 14).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Vertebræ.</b>—In each space between the bodies
of the vertebræ there is a <i>meniscus intervertebralis</i>. This meniscus
is analogous to the annulus fibrosus of mammals (Gadow), which,
is possibly formed as a protrusion of the anterior surface of the vertebral
body. The meniscus or disc may develop into a ring-shaped
structure, the true meniscus, or it may develop to different degrees
as an extension of the vertebral body surface, and become, as in the
dorsal and lumbar regions, fused with the vertebral segments, in
which case it is called the annulus fibrosus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vertebral disc which is connected with the atlas and which
is fused with that bone, represents the first meniscus, which is called
the <i>ligamentum transversum atlantis</i>. This, as well as other ligaments
of the spinal column, may become ossified.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ligament which is located between those vertebral bodies
which face each other and is inside the joint cavity, is called the
<i>ligamentum suspensorium corporum vertebralium</i>. It passes through
the central opening of the meniscus and lies exactly in the long axis
of the body of the vertebra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first ligament of the neck is the <i>ligamentum suspensorium
dentis epistrophei</i>. The <i>ligamentum capsulare atlantico-occipitale</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and the <i>ligamentum capsulare atlantico-epistrophicum odontoideum</i>
are two parts of the joint capsule of the vertebral body. Other
ligaments of this part are the <i>membranæ obturatoriæ intervertebrales
posteriores</i>, which are located between the semicircular rims of the
neck vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum transversum atlantis</i> surrounds the occipital
condyle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum nuchæ</i> is a thin, membranous, ribbon-like structure
which lies between the muscles of the right and those of the
left side of the middle, and the lower part on the posterior of the neck,
and ends in attachments to the superior spines of the cervical
vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum elasticum interspinale profundum</i> and the <i>ligamentum
elasticum interspinale superficiale</i> and the three last named
are the ligaments which keep the neck of the fowl in the s-shape,
without the action of the muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum capsulare obliquum</i> connects the facets of the
oblique processes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Ribs.</b>—The thick inferior end of the sternal portion
of the true rib has two small articular heads, which articulate
with two depressions in the articular surface of the sternum. This
articulation is held firm by a <i>capsular ligament</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The upper end of the sternal rib forms an almost perfect right angle
with the inferior end of the dorsal rib with which it is connected by a
joint provided with a synovial apparatus and a capsular ligament.
This arrangement allows free movement outward and inward and is
the main joint in respiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The upper end of the dorsal portion of the rib articulates with the
dorsal vertebra. The joint formed by the articular head with the
body of the vertebra is provided with a capsular ligament. The
tubercle of the rib articulates with the facet on the transverse process
of the dorsal vertebra, and is provided with a transverse ligament,
called the <i>ligamentum transversum externum</i>. It is also provided
with a capsular ligament.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum triangulare</i> connects each processus uncinatus
with the succeeding rib. This ligament is in the form of a membranous
sheet, or aponeurosis.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Sternum</b> (Fig. 13).—The external and the internal
notches of the sternum are bridged over with a thin membrane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>which gives an extensive surface for muscular attachments. The

<p class='c007'>The sternum is connected by a fibrous mass with the inferior
portion of the clavicle, or hypocledium (Fig. 57), the <i>claviculosternal
ligament</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inferior narrow elongated end of the coracoid forms with the
sternum a true articulation, which is provided with a capsular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>ligament, the <i>ligamentum capsulare</i>. Capsular ligaments occur at
the articulations between the sternum and ribs.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Shoulder-joint</b> (Fig. 13).—The shoulder-joint
is made up of the scapula, the humerus, and the coracoid. The ends
of these three bones form the <i>foramen triosseum</i> (Fig. 15, No. <i>A</i>, 7)
through which passes the tendon of the elevator muscle of the wing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The furcula, independent of the shoulder-joint or girdle, is attached
to the supero-internal part of the proximal end of the coracoid by
fibrous connective tissue; it is also connected to the other bones of
the shoulder-joint by the <i>ligamentum coraco-furculare</i> and the
<i>ligamentum furculo-scapulare</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum coraco-scapulare</i> extends from the tuberosity of
the furcula to the coracoid and to the processus furcularis of the
scapula.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum coracoido-scapulare externum</i> extends between
the external tuberosity of the coracoid, the tuberosity of the scapula,
and the humerus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ligamentum coracoideo-scapulare inferius</i> extends from the
coracoid to the inner tubercle of the scapula.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another long, broad ligament belongs to the episternal apparatus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shoulder-joint is provided with a wide, loose, <i>capsular ligament</i>
(Fig. 13, No. 13). Attached to the humerus are four other
ligaments, of which three pass from the anterior end of the coracoid
and the fourth from the scapula. The latter are as follows: first, the
<i>supero-anterior ligamentum humero-coracoideum</i>, which extends from
the small tubercle of the humerus to the coracoid bone; second, the
<i>antero-inferior ligamentum humero-coracoideum</i>, which extends from
the humerus to the coracoid; third, the <i>ligamentum coraco-humerale</i>,
which extends from the coracoid to the large tubercle of the humerus;
fourth, the <i>ligamentum humero-scapulare</i> which extends between the
processus humeralis of the scapula and the head of the humerus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ligaments of the Elbow-joint</b> (Fig. 14).—The elbow-joint is made
up of the ulna, radius and the humerus. The ligaments of the elbow-joint

  <h2 class='c005'>MYOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>Kinds and Structure of Muscles.</b>—Muscles are highly specialized
structures which have the property of contractility when stimulated,
and thus produce motion. Muscular tissue is sometimes called
flesh. Two kinds of muscles are recognized; muscles of locomotion
and visceral muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The muscles of locomotion may be in masses of different shape
attached to the skin, the <i>dermal</i>, or to the skin and skeletal structure,
the <i>dermo-osseous</i>, or from one bone to another, the <i>skeletal</i>. The
visceral muscles form sheets and make up a portion of the wall of
many of the hollow organs, such as the intestines, the stomach,
the gizzard, the esophagus, and the blood-vessels. A special type
of muscle forms the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>When classified with reference to structure, muscular tissue
is divided into three types, as follows: voluntary-striated, involuntary,
and involuntary-striated. The microscopic examination
of each of these types of muscle shows it to be made up of fibers,
these fibers to be made up of muscle cells, the muscle cell to be inclosed
in a delicate tubular sheath, or membrane, called the <i>sarcolemma</i>.
This membrane, tough and elastic, isolates each fiber.
The bundles of fibers, called <i>fasciculi</i>, are surrounded by a fibrous
sheath, which is called the <i>perimysium internum</i>; and the entire
muscle has likewise an investing sheath of connective tissue, called
the <i>perimysium externum</i>. The muscular cells show a longitudinal
striation marking the fibrillæ, and they also show a cross striation.
Nuclei are found just beneath the covering, or sarcolemma, in the
striated muscle cell (Fig. 77, No. 2). In the involuntary and in the
involuntary-striated muscle cell, the nuclei are centrally located.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>voluntary-striated muscles</i> consist of cylindrical fibers and with
a few exceptions, are under the control of the will. A muscle of
this type, the regular skeletal form, usually has at each extremity a
fibrous structure, called a tendon, by means of which it is attached
to the bones. The intermediate fleshy portion of the muscle, in
case of considerable bulk, is called the belly of the muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>involuntary</i>, <i>non-striated</i>, or <i>smooth muscle</i>, cells are spindle-shaped,
long, and pale in color (Fig. 77, No. 1). The cells lie end to
end forming fibers. These fibers do not terminate in tendons, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>are arranged in sheets and aid in forming the walls of the digestive
tract, to which they give the power of contraction and expansion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Involuntary-striated</i>, or <i>heart muscle</i> (Fig. 77, No. 4), occupies
an intermediate position between the two muscles just described.
It is composed of cells which branch, are somewhat rectangular.
They possess both longitudinal and transverse striation. Among
the fibers is found a small amount of connective tissue, as in the
former types of muscle, which gives support to the blood-vessels
and nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Fascia.</b>—The term fascia is applied to membranous expansions,
differing materially in strength, texture, and relations. Fascia is
composed of loosely arranged white fibrous connective tissue. At
least two layers may usually be distinguished, the superficial fascia
and the deep fascia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below the skin is the <i>superficial fascia</i>, which forms a continuous
covering over the whole body and serves to attach the skin to the
underlying structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>deep fascia</i> more densely constructed, may be attached to
the skeleton, ligaments, and tendons.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the fascia spreads out, becomes denser, and acts as a continuation
of a muscle, it is called an aponeurosis.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Muscular Nomenclature.</b>—In the fowl there are 162 muscles,
single or in pairs. These muscles are named from their location,
as the lingualis; others from their attachments, as the dermo-temporalis;
some from their form, as the rhomboideus; others from their
use, as the flexor or extensor; and still others from their direction,
as the transversus.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>The Dermal Muscles</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Birds are provided with a system of delicate muscles divided into
numerous fasciculi, which harmoniously act upon the feather quills
and collectively agitate the plumage. These are the dermal muscles.
This group is divided into two subgroups: the true dermal muscles,
that is, those that have their origin and insertion to the under surface
of the skin; and the dermo-osseous, those that originate on the
surface of some bone and insert to the inner surface of the skin.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SPLANCHNOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>The Digestive Apparatus.</b>—This apparatus, apparatus digestorius,
consists of the organs directly concerned in the reception of food, in
its passage through the body, and in the expulsion of the unabsorbed
portion. For convenience, these organs are grouped as follows: the
alimentary canal and the accessory organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alimentary canal is a tube which extends from the mouth to
the anus. It has a complete lining of mucous membrane, external
to which is an almost continuous muscular coat. The abdominal
portion of the tube is largely covered with a serous membrane, the
visceral peritoneum. The canal consists of the following consecutive
segments: mouth, pharynx, first portion of the esophagus, crop,
second portion of the esophagus, proventriculus, gizzard, small
intestine, large intestine, and cloaca.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accessory organs are beak, tongue, salivary glands, liver, and
pancreas.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Mouth</b> (Fig. 27).—The distinctive character of the mouth
of the fowl consists, in the absence of lips and teeth and instead of
jaw bones of other animals, of a <i>beak</i>. The edge of the beak is
covered by a horn-like gum. The shape of the beak differs in the
various classes of birds. In the chicken the beak is short, strong,
thick, and pointed; in palmipeds it is flattened. The upper mandible
extends out over the lower mandible. The outer portion of the
upper and the lower beaks is covered by a horny sheath. There
is no velum, and the mouth cavity is extended rather continuously
into the pharynx (Fig. 27, No. 4). The posterior cross bar of the
hard palate (Fig. 27, No. 5), which possesses a row of filiform papillæ
projecting backward, marks the upper boundary line of the mouth;
while the posterior end of the tongue (Fig. 27, No. 6), likewise with
a row of filiform papillæ, marks its lower boundary line.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Parts of the Mouth.</i>—The mouth of fowls is divided into an upper
and a lower half. The upper half is divided into an anterior and a
posterior part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior part extends from the anterior tip of the beak to the
posterior nares. It is further divided into an outer hard part and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>an inner soft part. The outer part is covered by epithelium which
may be considered as a continuation from the upper outer portion
of the beak. A portion of this is cornified. The inner part is covered
by a mucous membrane containing mucous glands, nerves, and
blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the posterior part of the upper half of the mouth, are situated
the posterior nares (Fig. 27, No. 10) which appear as a longitudinal
slit in the center of the hard palate. There is also found in this
part a furrow which contains the opening of the Eustachian tubes,
or tubæ auditivæ. There are also two ridges near the same posterior
part in which are red and white papillæ, which may appear
in rows, and which contain mucous glands.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The lower half of the mouth lies between the lower jaw bones and
the walls of the mouth cavity. The tongue is attached here by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>means of the phrenum (Fig. 27, No. 8). This half of the mouth
forms a pocket-like structure which aids in taking up the food.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mouth cavity is lined with stratified squamous epithelium,
continuous with that of the pharynx and the esophagus. Taste
buds are located in the mucous membrane of the mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many water fowls, as geese and ducks, the gum edge of the
mandible has grooves extending crosswise, in which are numerous
terminals of the trigeminus nerve arranged as taste organs (Fig. 29,
<i>G</i> and Fig. 28, <i>D</i> and <i>F</i>). In many birds of prey and in water birds,
<i>e.g.</i>, the goose and the duck, there is found at the base of the beak,
a very thin, nervous or sensitive skin, waxy in appearance, called
the ceroma.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Tongue</b> (Fig. 27, No. 3). <i>Location.</i>—The tongue (lingua) of
the fowl is situated in the floor of the mouth between the rami of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>lower mandible, and is slung to the cranium by the cerato-branchial
element of the os hyoideum (Fig. 18, No. 2).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The tongue, is pointed in front and wide behind, shaped
like an Indian arrow-head, and is supported by the bony and
cartilaginous hyoid apparatus (Fig. 9, <i>A</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The free part of the tongue consists of two long tubes
which are formed by the rolling in of the ventral sides of its horny
coverings. The <i>dorsal plate</i>, which constitutes one-half of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>horny sheath, does not form a part of the tubes, but ends in the
region of the point of the entoglossum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The top surface is covered by a thick stratum corneum, giving it
a rather horny surface. Glands occur in the posterior part of the
tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>While not so freely movable as in mammals, the tongues of birds
are very flexible.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Pharynx</b> (Fig. 27). <i>Location.</i>—The anterior part of the
pharynx joins with the mouth and the posterior part with the upper
portion of the esophagus and the superior larynx. The pharynx is
bounded anteriorly by the base of the tongue and by the posterior
edge of the hard palate. Posteriorly, it is marked by the entrance of
the esophagus and by a ridge of filiform papillæ located on the
supero-posterior part of the larynx, called the palatal papillaries.
A few filiform papillæ stud the roof. The pharynx communicates
anteriorly with the posterior nares and the mouth, and, posteriorly,
with the esophagus and the larynx.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The pharynx is a musculo-membranous sac.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The pharynx is lined with a mucous membrane
covered by squamous epithelium. The mucous membrane is thrown
into irregular folds. The bird has two Eustachian tubes. Pneumatic
apertures conduct the air from the Eustachian tubes to the
pericranial diploë.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the posterior pharyngeal roof is situated the infundibular
crevice.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The function of the pharynx is to give passage for the
air from the posterior nares to the larynx, and to give passage for
the food from the <i>mouth</i> to the esophagus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Glands Adjacent to the Mouth and to the Pharynx.</b>—The
mucous membrane adjacent to the glottis and in the roof of
the mouth contains alveolar glands. The <i>angular gland</i> of the
mouth, located beneath the zygomatic arch, by some anatomists is
considered the rudimentary parotid gland. The <i>sublingual glands</i>,
or glandulæ sublinguales, are well developed (Fig. 17, No. <i>B</i>, 4).
They form conical masses, with the apex directed anteriorly, and
occupy a portion of the intermaxillary space. Several ducts from
these glands open into the mouth cavity. In the palatine region
there are also located glands called the <i>palatine glands</i>, which open
by many stomata upon the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span><b>The Esophagus</b> (Fig. 18, No. 6). <i>Location and Shape.</i>—The
esophagus is a musculo-membranous tube, capable of great distension,
which extends from the pharynx to the proventriculus
(Fig. 35, No. 1, and 3).</p>

<p class='c007'>The esophagus communicates anteriorly with the pharynx. It
extends down the neck, lying supero-laterally with regard to the
trachea and toward the right side. It enters the thorax above the
trachea, and, passing through between the bronchi, terminates into
the proventriculus. At the entrance of the thorax and just to the
right of the median line, it expands into the crop which divides it
into two portions, designated as the first and the second. The
first portion of the esophagus is the longer, the length depending
upon the size and kind of fowl.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The wall is composed of four coats, the mucous
membrane, the submucosa, the muscular coats, and the fibrous
sheath or tunic. The mucous membrane is pale and is covered with
stratified squamous epithelium.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mucous membrane is loosely attached to the muscular coat
by the submucosa. Except during deglutition it lies in longitudinal
folds which obliterate the lumen. Opening from the mucosa are
lenticular glands, which may be seen on inflating an esophagus
and looking through its transparent walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The muscular coat of the esophagus is divided into two layers,
an outer longitudinal and an inner circular layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outer fibrous sheath connects the esophagus loosely to the
surrounding structures.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The function of the esophagus is to give passage way
for the food from the pharynx to the crop and from the crop to the
proventriculus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Crop</b> (Fig. 35, No. 2; Figs. 30 and 31). <i>Location and Shape.</i>—The
crop, or ingluvies, saccular in shape, is located at the entrance
of the thorax and just to the right of the median line. The first
portion of the esophagus empties into the crop superiorly and
inferiorly the crop opens into the second portion of the esophagus.
Like the esophagus the crop is capable of great distension.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The wall of the crop is composed of four coats, the
mucous membrane, submucosa, muscular and the outer fibrous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crop is lined with mucous membrane containing mucous glands
which secrete a mucus to keep the surface moist. The surface of the
mucous membrane is covered by stratified squamous epithelium.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>The submucosa connects the mucous membrane to the muscular
coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wall of the crop is provided with strong muscles. The
fibrous coat, or tunic, connects it with the surrounding structures.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The crop is a storehouse for the food during the hours
of feeding, the food when needed by the stomach being gradually
discharged from the crop by the contraction of its muscular walls.
The subcutaneous cervical muscles which cover this reservoir aid in
this discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the <i>act of deglutition</i>, the food, after being subjected to the
fluid supplied in the mouth by the adjacent glands, is poised upon
the tongue and swallowed partly by a sudden jerk of the head, and
partly by means of the pressure of the tongue against the hard
palate, the food then passes down the esophagus and lodges first
in the crop, till needed by the stomach, when it is passed through the
second portion of the esophagus to the first portion of the stomach,
the proventriculus. The time during which food remains in the
crop depends upon the nature of the food. Animal food will, in
part, be retained about eight hours and vegetable foods may not all
be passed on for from sixteen to eighteen hours.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Stomach</b> (Fig. 31, No. 7; Fig. 32, <i>B</i>).—The stomach, or
ventriculus, of fowls is made up of two portions, namely, the pars
glandularis, or proventriculus, and the pars muscularis, or gizzard.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Proventriculus.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The proventriculus lies in the
superior part of the groove formed by the two lobes of the liver, is
inferior to the aorta, and is directed slightly to the left, communicating
anteriorly with the second portion of the esophagus and posteriorly
emptying into the pars muscularis, the gizzard.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The proventriculus is round transversely and elongated,
in fact, nearly fusiform. In the hen of average size it measures about
1.62 inches long and 0.8 inch in diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The wall of the proventriculus has four coats, the
mucous, submucous, muscular, and serous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inner mucous coat which is raised in folds, is lined with
columnar epithelial cells. The mucous membrane contains lymphoid
tissue. The mucous coat throughout contains simple tubular
glands which secrete a highly acid fluid which finds its way to the
surface through small cylindrical ducts lying at right angles to the
inner surface of the mucous membrane (Fig. 32, No. <i>B</i>, 1).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The submucosa, connects the mucous and muscular coats and
the muscularis layer throws the mucous membrane into folds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Outside the muscularis mucosa there is another layer (Fig. 32,
<i>A</i>), of simple tubular glands, grouped in lobules, and lined by
cuboidal cells and separated from each other by clefts. These
tubular glands converge toward the center and open into the same
cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The middle muscular coat can be divided into three layers:
two thin, longitudinal layers, and a thick, circular layer interposed
between the other two.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The function of the proventriculus appears to be
to soak the food with a secretion. The secretion from the proventriculus
is similar to that produced by the fundus glands of the
stomach of mammals. It contains acid and a ferment-pepsin.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Gizzard</b> (Fig. 31, No. 18). <i>Location.</i>—The gizzard, or muscular
stomach, occupies a portion of the central part of the abdominal
cavity (Fig. 33, No. 4). It lies slightly to the left and just behind
the liver, the proventriculus, and the spleen, and rests upon a mass
of intestines. The gizzard communicates at its anterior portion
with the proventriculus and with the duodenum. These openings
are close together. The gizzards of a large number of hens of
average size averaged in weight as follows: full, 0.215 pound;
empty, 0.126 pound. The gizzard stands perpendicularly and
somewhat obliquely in the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—In shape the gizzard is roundish, flattened laterally.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The walls of the gizzard are very thick and are made
up of three coats: mucous, muscular, and serous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cavity of the gizzard is covered by a thick skin-like structure
possessing a heavy stratified squamous epithelial layer which is
thrown somewhat into ridges (Fig. 32, <i>B</i>). This membrane becomes
thinnest near the edges.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mucous membrane, being cornified and readily detachable,
is by some anatomists considered as a special membrane (Fig.
37, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>At the pyloric opening there is a valve formed by a fold of the
mucous membrane, which prevents grit and large particles of food
from passing out of the gizzard.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>On each side it has a powerful fleshy muscle, the <i>muscularis
lateralis</i>. These musculares laterales are hemispherical, consist of
very closely packed fibers extending transversely, and are attached
to strong anterior and posterior ligamentous tendons. They are
joined at the edge of the organ by a strong aponeurosis. The
muscular fibers are red but do not possess cross striations; they are
of the smooth type. The <i>muscularis intermedii</i>, thinner and less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>developed than the musculares laterales, occurs on each of the
anterior and the posterior parts of the gizzard.</p>

<p class='c007'>The serous coat covers over the greater part of the external surface
of the gizzard and closely adheres to the muscular coat.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The hard callous pads of the gizzard, operated by the
powerful muscles above described, together with grit, act like mill
stones and make reduction to fineness very complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the posterior part there is a sacculated portion containing
glands of the long tubular type which secrete a fluid ferment
similar to that secreted by the glands of the pyloric portion of the
stomach of mammals. These glands also exist in a small band near
the entrance of the gizzard. Here the food is mixed with strongly
acid secretion containing pepsin which makes gastric digestion
perfect.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Small Intestine</b> (Fig. 31, No. 8 and 9).—The small intestine,
intestinum tenue, is the tube which connects the gizzard with the
large intestine. It is divided into two parts, the duodenum and the
free portion. Of the three parts as considered in the mammalian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>intestine, only the first, the <i>duodenum</i>, can be distinguished. There
is no demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum. The jejunum
and the ileum or that part which represents these sections,
are in coils suspended from the free border of the mesentery the
other border of which is, in turn, attached to the dorsal wall (Fig.
64). The length of the small intestine in a hen of average size is
about 61.7 inches.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The mucous membrane which lines the intestine is thick, soft, and
highly vascular. It has a velvety appearance, due to numerous long,
thin projecting <i>villi</i>. The villi (Fig. 36, <i>A</i>) are concerned in the
absorption of the digested food, absorbing principally the emulsified
fats. Each villus is covered with a single layer of high columnar
epithelial cells. Some of these, the so-called goblet cells, provide
mucin which lubricates the mucous surface. These cells are found
in all mucous surfaces and prevent the surface from becoming dry.
There are a few goblet cells near the summits of the villi. Openings
of simple intestinal tubular glands the duodenal glands, or the
glands formerly known as <i>Brunner’s glands</i>, are located between the
villi. These glands secrete the succus entericus, or intestinal juice.
These openings, or stomata, are lined with granular cells. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>reaction of the contents of the small intestine is strongly acid, but
gradually less so in proportion to the distance down the intestinal
tract until the cæca are reached, where the reaction is found to be
faintly acid, neutral, or slightly alkaline.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The function of the small intestine is that of digestion
and absorption.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Duodenum.</b> <i>Location and Shape.</i>—The duodenum, a small
tube, originates from the gizzard about ½ inch to the right of
the entrance of the proventriculus. Extending from left to right,
it passes under and behind the gizzard along the inner side of the
right abdominal wall backward to the posterior portion of the wall,
and a trifle more than half way toward the left side, where the loop
rests. This loop, the duodenal loop, is about 5 inches in length (Fig.
31, No. 8). The two branches of the loop the first and the second
portions or the descending and ascending limbs, are loosely held by
connective tissue, and have the pancreas lodged between them.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Free Portion of the Small Intestine.</b> <i>Location.</i>—That section
of the small intestine following the duodenum is called the free
portion of the small intestine and occupies the space between the
abdominal air-sac and the median line of the abdominal cavity.
It is disposed in coils and is suspended from the dorsal wall of the
abdomen by a thin membrane, the mesentery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bile ducts enter the small intestine about 14 inches from
its point of origin. The pancreas also pours its contents into the
small intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Large Intestine</b> (Fig. 31, No. 12). <i>Location.</i>—The large
intestine extends in a straight line along the inferior border of the
vertebral column communicating anteriorly with the small intestine,
and the cæca and posteriorly with the cloaca.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The diameter of the large intestine is approximately
twice that of the small intestine. In fowls of average size its mean
length is 4.61 inches. The large intestine has sometimes been spoken
of as the rectum, or straight gut.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—Like the small intestine the large intestine has four
coats: an inner mucous, a submucous, a middle muscular and an
outer serous. The folds of mucous membrane of the large intestine
have tubular glands lined with columnar cells (Fig. 37, <i>A</i>, No. 1).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The large intestine is similar in function to that of the
small intestine, in that digestion and absorption may take place
within it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span><b>The Cæca</b> (Fig. 31, No. 11). <i>Location.</i>—The fowl has two cæca
extending forward from their point of origin at the juncture of the
small and large intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The cæca average 7.61 inches in length. They are large
in caliber toward the blind extremity and are constricted near their
origin.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The parietal coats are continued from the small
intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ebarth has described an elevated body in the cæcum, which is
located about 4 millimeters from the opening and is composed entirely
of lymphoid tissue.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The cæca are usually partly filled with a soft pultaceous material
of a pasty consistency.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Cloaca</b> (Fig. 31, No. 13). <i>Location.</i>—The rectum opens by a
circular, valvular orifice into the dilated portion just in front of the
anus, which dilatation is called the cloaca.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The cloaca is saccular in shape.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The cloaca is divided into two portions, the coprodeumal
and the urodeumal. That portion of the cloaca into which
the intestine empties is called the <i>coprodeum</i>; and the ureter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>oviduct empty into the <i>urodeum</i>. The seminiferous tubules,
carrying the semen from the testes in the male empty in teatlike
projections on the cloacal mucous membrane into the urodeumal
portion. The cloacal walls are similar in structure to the large
intestines.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the dorsal wall of the cloaca between it and the spine, is a
small sac, called the <i>bursa of Fabricius</i>, which has a duct communicating
with the cloaca. The mucous membrane of this sac is thrown
into folds and is studded with glands. The bursa of Fabricius is
larger in the young than in the adult bird. It apparently atrophies
as the bird becomes older. When the bird is four months old this
bursa is best developed, and at this age it may be as large as 2 or 3
centimeters in diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The function of the cloaca is to give passage way to
the feces, the urine, and the egg and to act as an organ of copulation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Course of the Food.</b>—The food first enters the mouth, after being
picked up by aid of the beak. From here it passes through the
pharynx and first portion of the esophagus to the crop, without
mastication, as the bird is not provided with teeth. The food is
passed from the crop by aid of its muscular walls as needed; thence
through the second portion of the esophagus to the proventriculus,
an expansion in the digestive tube just before it terminates in the
gizzard. The glands of the proventriculus produce a secretion in
which the food is soaked before passing into the gizzard. The
gizzard is provided with strong muscular walls which, by aid of grit,
thoroughly reduce the food to fineness. From the gizzard the food
passes through the first portion of the small intestine, where it is
subjected to the action of the bile from the liver, the pancreatic
juice from the pancreas, and of the succus entericus from the glands
of the intestinal wall. The food is then passed into the cæca. The
indigestible portion of the food passes from the cæca through the
large intestine, or rectum, to the cloaca and thence to the external
world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The digestive functions of the bird are very potent and rapid.
This compensates for the waste caused by their extensive, frequent,
and energetic motions, and is in accordance with the rapidity of their
circulation and their high state of irritability.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE ACCESSORY ORGANS OF DIGESTION</h3>

<p class='c015'>The accessory organs of digestion are the liver, pancreas, and
some anatomists include also the spleen. The first two manufacture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>fluids containing ferments which aid in splitting or digesting the
food.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Liver</b> (Figs. 31, 33 and 34). <i>Location.</i>—The liver, hepar,
lies ventrally and posteriorly to the heart. It is related anteriorly
with the diaphragm, inferiorly with the sternum, posteriorly with
the gizzard and intestine, and superiorly with the ovary, oviduct
and proventriculus and laterally with the abdominal wall.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The liver is a voluminous deep livid brown gland, soft
and friable in texture. It is divided into two principal lobes, a
right and a left.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right lobe is larger than the left. In the hen of average size
the liver weighs 35 grams. The parietal surface is convex and
smooth. The surface which lies against the viscera is irregularly
concave. The visceral surface furnishes exit for the bile duct and
passage for the nerves and blood-vessels. This part is called the
porta.</p>

<p class='c007'>The left lobe may be cleft from below so deeply as to form two
lobes on that side.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—Each lobe is covered by a double serous membrane,
one closely adherent, the other surrounding the structure loosely.
These tunics, which are reflections of the peritoneum, are continued
from the base of the liver, over both the anterior, and the posterior
surface. The loose layer is formed by the air cells surrounding the
lobes. The thin border of the liver is usually free.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two lobes of the liver are connected by a narrow isthmus of
liver tissue. Occasionally there is a bird in which there occurs a
<i>lobus Spigelii</i> located at the posterior of the liver between the two
principal lobes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apex of the heart sacculates the diaphragm backward, so that
part of this apex lies between the right and the left lobes (Fig.
43, No. 6 and 7). A ligament, the <i>falciform</i>, extends from the apex
of the pericardial membrane, and attaching it rather firmly to the
central connective tissue, or interlobar ligament. This ligament
also has attachments to the inner surface of the sternum. The
<i>broad ligament</i> of the liver is formed posteriorly by a fold of the
peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>interlobar</i>, or <i>principal, ligament of the liver</i> is formed by a
large and strong duplicature of the peritoneum, which makes a
longitudinal division in the abdominal cavity similar to the lateral
division made by the thoracic mediastinum in mammals. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>is reflected upon the pericardium from the linea alba and the middle
line of the sternum, and passes deeply into the interspace of the
lobes of the liver. It is attached to these lobes throughout their
whole length and connects them below to one side of the gizzard.
The lateral and posterior part of the liver attach to the adjacent air
cells, and the whole viscus is thus kept fixed in its position during
rapid and violent movements of the bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remains of the umbilical veins are traceable within the duplicature
of the membranes forming the septum. These remains thus
represent the round ligament of mammals.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A microscopic study of the liver of the fowl shows a compact mass
of liver cells polyhedral in shape, with large nuclei (Fig. 38, <i>A</i>).
The liver tissue differs from that of mammals in that there is no
clearly outlined lobular arrangement; neither is the outline of the
individual cell so well marked. The parenchymatous portion is
made up of columns of liver tissue. These columns anastomose and
show narrow channels between. They are best seen in the young
chick.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—One of the functions of the liver is to secrete bile. A
<i>gall-bladder</i>, which receives part of the bile secreted by the right lobe
of the liver, is located on the posterior face of this lobe. Extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>from this gall-bladder there is a duct, the <i>cystic duct</i>, which empties
into the small intestine toward the extremity of the second branch of
the duodenal loop. Another duct called the <i>hepatic duct</i>, proceeds
directly from the two lobes of the liver and empties into the intestine
just in front of the cystic duct.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Pancreas</b> (Fig. 31, No. 17). <i>Location and Shape.</i>—The pancreas,
an organ lying in the duodenal loop is a yellowish-white, lobulated
gland, elongated in shape. Its average length in fowls of
average size is 4.96 inches, and the average weight about 0.008 pound.
The pancreas is divided into lobes, which in turn are divided into
lobules.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The pancreas has a supporting connective tissue.
The lobules are made up of small alveolar glands, which are lined
with columnar epithelial cells. The ducts leading from the alveoli
are small; these unite to form larger ducts in which the epithelium
is taller. Between the alveoli throughout the pancreas there are
clusters of polyhedral cells which form the <i>islands of Langerhans</i>.
These islands are said to produce an internal secretion, or hormone,
which is absorbed by the blood or lymph capillaries and thus enters
the circulation (Fig. 38, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The function of the pancreas is to secrete a fluid containing
digestive ferments.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Spleen</b> (Fig. 31, No. 21). <i>Location.</i>—The spleen, or lien,
lies in a triangle formed by the proventriculus, the liver, and the
gizzard.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—It is a reddish-brown body shaped like a buckeye, is small
in size, weighing only about 0.005 pound.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The outer surface of the spleen is covered by a reflection
of the peritoneum. After this covering is removed, there is
observed a firm, white, fibrous layer, the <i>cortical portion</i>. This
covering sends into the interior small and large trabeculæ, forming
a framework and dividing it into acini, or compartments. The
spaces are filled with a dark red parenchymatous material called
<i>splenic pulp</i>. The framework, in both deep and surface portions,
are found elastic fibers and smooth muscular fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spleen is essentially a lymphatic organ, its peculiar structure
depending largely upon the arrangement of the blood-vessels.
Compact lymphatic tissue occurs in the spleen in spherical, oval, or
cylindrical collections of closely packed lymphoid cells. These
masses are known as the <i>Malpighian bodies</i>, or <i>splenic corpuscles</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>They are distributed throughout the splenic pulp. Each splenic
corpuscle contains one or more small arteries. These extend near
the periphery of the corpuscle and more rarely in the center.</p>

<p class='c007'>The splenic artery passes in and the splenic veins out at the
hilum which is located on the concave, or attached, side of the
spleen. The splenic artery, upon entering the organ, at once
branches, the trabeculæ forming a support for the vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the arteries have entered the hilum, as stated above, they
divide into many branches which follow the septa of the connective
tissue. At first the arteries are accompanied by branches of the
splenic veins. Soon, however, the arteries leave the veins and the
septa, and penetrate the splenic pulp. In the splenic pulp the
adventitia of the smaller arteries assume the character of reticular
tissue, and become infiltrated with lymphoid cells. This infiltration
forms masses which are called the splenic corpuscles, or Malpighian
bodies. The terminal arteries break up into capillaries, which still
retain an adventitia, and empty into border spaces, or sinuses,
sometimes spoken of as ampullæ. These sinuses in turn empty into
cavernous sinuses of the splenic pulp. From these are finally
formed the venules; and the collections of venules form the splenic
veins through which the blood gains exit from the spleen.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Abdominal and Pelvic Cavities.</b>—In birds the abdominal
cavity is divided into two smaller cavities by a fibrous septum. The
anterior cavity representing the abdominal contains the liver, and
the other representing the pelvic contains the gizzard, intestines and
oviduct.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Peritoneum and the Mesentery.</b>—The abdominal and pelvic
cavities are lined by the peritoneum. Like all serous membranes
this is composed of a parietal and a visceral portion, which together
form a complete sac, with the organs it covers situated on the outer
side. The peritoneum like other serous membranes consists of a
mesothelial and a submesothelial portion, the cells of the former
being arranged in a single layer. Since a serous membrane is so
arranged as to line a closed cavity, and at the same time to cover
its contents, it follows that the entire membrane must be a closed
sac, the mesothelial layer being on the inside; such a sac is called
a serous sac, or cavity. Synovial membranes are also regarded as
a variety of serous membranes. The fold, or layer, of the membrane
which lines the cavity is called the parietal, that which
covers the greater part of the organs contained therein is called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>visceral portion; the two surfaces contacting, and gliding upon each
other, are lubricated by a fluid secretion contained in the sac; hence
one use of these membranes is to prevent friction between the walls
of cavities and the organs contained therein. Serous membranes
line the abdominal cavity, pericardium, cavities of the heart and is
continuous throughout the vascular structures.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The serous membrane besides covering the external surface of the
viscera, double folds pass from one organ to another, or from an
organ to the parietes of the cavity. These double folds of the
peritoneum are known as ligaments, or as mesenteries. In ligaments
the two folds are strengthened by an interposed layer of fibro-elastic
tissue. A <i>mesentery</i> is a broad, double fold of peritoneum, attached
to the abdominal parietes above, and containing a portion of the
intestine in its free or remote extremity. Between its folds we find
blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics or lacteals, hence it permits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>vascular and nervous communications with the organ attached to it.
The free portion of the small intestine is attached to the free margin
of the mesentery.</p>

at 12, Fig. 33. The lungs are spread out occupying the posterior
thoracic region and below at No. 10 is the diaphragm. The diaphragm
does not appear to have that rigidity and firmness of position
as in mammals. It is rather rudimentary. Below the left lung and
above the left lobe of the liver is the proventriculus. Note that
the viscus is empty and that the mucous membrane is thrown into
folds. At this point the liver occupies much of the abdominal

  <h2 class='c005'>THE URO-GENITAL SYSTEM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The uro-genital apparatus, or apparatus uro-genitalis, consists
of two groups of organs: the urinary and the genital. The former
elaborate and remove the chief excretory fluid, the urine; and the
latter serve for the formation, development, and expulsion of the
products of the reproductive glands.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE URINARY APPARATUS (Fig. 50 and Fig. 51).</h3>

<p class='c015'>The urinary apparatus of the bird consists of two kidneys, from
each of which a ureter extends and empties into the cloaca.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Kidneys.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The kidneys are located in excavations
in the pelvic roof. They are related internally with the posterior
aorta and vena cava, supero-internally with the lumbo-sacral vertebræ
and superiorly and supero-externally with the ilium. The
abdominal visceral organs lie below the kidneys. The kidneys are
external to or above the peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—In the fowl of average size the kidneys are 2½ inches
long and are made up of three irregular lobes. The anterior lobe
is usually the largest and the middle the smallest. The anterior
border of the first lobe is located opposite the last true dorsal articulation.
The anterior lobe is called the anterior pelvic or ilio-lumbar
lobe, the middle the middle pelvic or ilio-sacral lobe, and the posterior
the posterior pelvic lobe.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The whole kidney has a fine transparent covering.
The dark, brownish-red parenchyme can be seen through this membrane.
It has a blood vascular system and a urinary tubular system.
The larger arteries, the veins, and the nerves pass between the
lobules, and the smaller vessels between the tubules. These form
fine network or plexuses. The lymphatic vessels are very few, and
are mainly found on the surface. The kidneys are pierced in their
posterior third by the external iliac artery and at about its middle
by the venous branches forming the posterior vena cava.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lobes are made up of <i>lobules</i>, which are plainly perceptible
from the external surface. Each lobule is apparently a unit within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>itself. It receives its blood supply from small branches of the
renal artery and is made up of a cortical or peripheral portion which
contains the glomerules (Fig. 52, <i>A</i>) and a medullary portion,
which is made up of tubules, or urinary canals, arteries, veins, and
nerves.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>urinary canals</i> are divided into two kinds, namely, the outer
and the inner tubular systems. The outer canals, called the <i>tubulæ
uriniferi corticalis</i>, are very small in caliber and are located in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>lobules. The renal artery (Fig. 53, No. <i>B</i>, 3) breaking up into
arterioles in the kidney, and finally reaching the cortical portion
of the lobules, form capillary plexuses in the shape of minute spheres,
which are the glomerules (Fig. 53, No. <i>C</i>, 3 and <i>B</i>, 5). Around each
glomerule there is formed a capsule called <i>Bowman’s capsule</i>, which
is the beginning of the uriniferous tubule. This entire mass is called
the <i>Malpighian body</i>, or <i>renal corpuscle</i>. This capsule then extends
as the urinary, or secreting tubule, being at first constricted,
then convoluted, and terminates into a second portion, the <i>descending
limb of Henle</i>. This portion of the tubule becomes constricted.
It then forms the loop of Henle and ascends as the second portion,
or second limb of Henle, which is again of greater diameter. The top
of the secreting tubule is slightly wavy and empties into the collecting
tubule along with many others. These collecting tubules
in turn merge into large tubules which finally empty into the ureter
(Fig. 53, No. 14). These collective bundles correspond to the pyramids
of the kidneys of mammals.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The neck of the uriniferous tubule as it emerges from Bowman’s
capsule is short and narrow and is lined with a few cuboidal cells.
Toward the glomerular end the cells are of a transitional form gradually
merging into the flat squamous type peculiar to Bowman’s
capsule. The first convoluted tubule is lined with irregular cuboidal
or pyramidal epithelial cells. The descending limb of Henle’s loop
is narrow and is lined with a simple layer of flat epithelial cells. In
the loop the epithelium changes from the flat type in the descending
limb to the cuboidal in the ascending limb. The ascending limb of
Henle’s loop again becomes broader and is lined with low cuboidal
cells. The second convoluted, or tortuous, tubule is lined with low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>cuboidal cells as are also the collecting tubules. The collecting
tubules originate from every part of the internal substance of the
lobules, and extending to the gyrations, uniting in the pinniform
structure and traversing to the margin of the lobules, following along
the uneven surface, infero-laterally and toward the median body line,
finally empty into the ureter.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many arterial branches given off from the arteria renalis.
The arteries which supply the kidneys are given off from the
posterior aorta and ischiadic artery. As soon as these arteries enter
the kidney they break up into two systems. One system supplies
the kidney substance with nourishment in the form of nutrient blood;
the second system supplies the glomerules with what may be considered
functional blood (Gadow). The second system of arteries
branches into the small arteria interlobularis, which pass between
the lobules of the kidneys where they give off side branches which
penetrate the cortical portion of the lobules and form the capillary
plexus, the glomerule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arteriole that enters into the structure of the glomerule is
lined with endothelial cells and is surrounded by a few muscle fibers
and a fine network of connective tissue. The vessel that carries the
blood away is similarly constructed.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—In the glomerules the liquid portion of the urine is
filtered out of the blood, which urine flows through the uriniferous
tubules and passes from the kidney through the ureter. In the
cubical cells are extracted the solid portions of the urine which also
pass through the tubules with the liquid. The urinary secretion,
as found in the ureter, does not contain much liquid, but, on the contrary,
is made up of a pasty material consisting of salts which are,
for the most part, uric acid crystals and sodium urate (Fig. 52, <i>B</i>).
This material becomes hard, like cement, soon after being exposed
to the atmosphere. This secretion may be noted as a whitish pasty
material on the outer parts of the feces, or droppings, voided by the
birds.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Ureter.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The ureter extends along the inferior surface
of the kidney. It has its origin near the anterior extremity of
the kidney, and passing posteriorly the entire length of the kidney
receives tributary collecting tubules, and terminates in the upper
wall of the cloaca in the urodeumal portion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The ureter gradually enlarges in diameter until it reaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>the posterior border of the kidney, and then maintains about the
same caliber throughout the rest of its course.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The ureter wall is made up of three coats as follows:
mucous, muscular and fibrous.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The ureters serve as a passage way for the urine from
the kidneys to the cloaca.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS (Fig. 54)</h3>

<p class='c015'>The male generative organs in the fowl consist of two testicles
and an excretory apparatus, the vas deferens, for each.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Testicles.</b> <i>Location.</i>—The testicles are located in the sublumbar
region of the abdominal cavity, behind the lungs, below the
anterior extremity of the kidneys, and opposite the last three ribs.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The testicles are ellipsoid in shape; their size varies
with the different species of birds. The two in the same bird are
usually of the same size, though one testicle may be slightly larger
than the other. In a summary of a large number of weights of the
testicles of ten months old cockerels, the average weight was 0.021
pound each. The average measurements were 2 inches in the major
diameter and 1 inch in the minor diameter. In the cockerel before
sexual maturity, which is denoted by the male bird’s crowing, the
testicles are very small. They resemble, in shape, a navy bean and
are yellowish-white in color.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span><i>Structure.</i>—The testicle is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule,
which, in the mature cock, is very vascular. This capsule sends
into the interior of the gland, septa which form the framework,
or supporting structure. This framework forms the spaces in which
are located the glandular substance. The glandular portion consists
of the <i>tubuli seminiferi</i>, which are lined with cubical cells. The
framework supporting these tubules gives passage to arterial
branches of the spermatic artery, which furnish an abundant blood
supply; the framework also supports the veins returning the blood
from the testicle. The seminiferous tubules end in blind extremities
in the epididymus or globus minor, and unite in the seminiferous
canals. All arteries, veins, lymphatics, and seminiferous tubules
enter or leave through the globus minor at the attached portion of
the testicle. The <i>epididymis</i> is made up largely of convoluted
tubules which are the continuation of the secreting tubules of the
globus major. The walls of the tubules of the globus minor become
thicker and are provided with smooth muscle cells in addition to
the connective tissue and endothelial lining. The convoluted
tubules empty into the vas deferens. The epididymus is covered
by the fibrous capsule; which corresponds to the tunica albuginea
of mammals and may be considered as a reflection or modification
of the visceral peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The substance of the testicle is very soft; in fact, it may be said
to be of the consistency of encephaloid material. It is made up
of secreting tubules in which are found the spermatozoa; it also
contains cells which produce an internal secretion, or hormone.
There is also produced some fluid in which the spermatozoa float,
the whole material manufactured constituting the semen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>spermatozoa</i> of the fowl are provided with long cylindrical
bodies, which may be straight or wavy (Fig. 55, <i>A</i>). The body
of the spermatozoon is obtuse anteriorly, and posteriorly, tapers
into a filimentary tail, or flagellum, of varying length, by the aid of
which the spermatozoon moves about in the fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The histological structure of the testicles of the baby chick at
hatching is approximately one-half white fibrous connective tissue.
The seminal tubules are small and widely distributed among the
connective tissue. The cells of these tubules possess rather large
nuclei, round in shape, with linin network and chromatin granules,
typical of resting germ cells. As the bird develops the testicles
grow, the seminal tubules become larger, and the amount of connective
tissue correspondingly less.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>In addition to the tubules, the spermatogenic cells, and the
connective tissue, there is also in the testicles more or less fat.
There is a small amount of connective tissue between the seminiferous
tubules, in which locations there are also clusters of polyhedral
cells, with round nuclei, others are the interstitial cells.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Vas Deferens</b> (Fig. 54, <i>D</i>). <i>Location and Shape.</i>—Extending
from the epididymus, is the vas deferens which runs backward
on the infero-internal surface of the kidney and to the outside of
the ureter. It is very tortuous passing on the infero-lateral surface
of the kidney in company with the ureter and becoming somewhat
expanded posteriorly it terminates in the upper wall of the cloaca
in a rather small papilla located in the uro-genital portion of the
cloaca anterior to the mouth of the ureter. This papilla is the
organ of copulation and in ducks is very large, and spirally elongated,
and retractile forming a kind of penis. The papilla is traversed
by a furrow on the upper surface through which the semen flows.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The vas deferens is covered and supported by the
peritoneum. Its wall is made up of a fibrous structure in which
may be found smooth muscle fibers. The wall does not possess
glands. It is lined with columnar epithelium. The posterior
end is expanded and terminates into a papilla. The base of the
papilla is surrounded by a plexus of arteries and veins, which serve
as an erectile organ during the venereal orgasm, when the fossa
of the turgid papilla is everted, and the semen brought into contact
with the similarly everted orifice of the oviduct of the female,
along which the spermatozoa pass by undulatory movements of
their ciliary appendage, or tail.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE FEMALE GENERATIVE ORGANS (Fig. 56)</h3>

<p class='c015'>The female generative organs consist of one ovary and an oviduct.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Location.</i>—The ovary is located similarly to the testicles of the
male bird, in the sublumbar region of the abdominal cavity, just
at the anterior end of the kidneys, posterior to the lungs, and slightly
to the left of the center.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—In the pullet the ovarian mass appears somewhat like a
bunch of grapes, being made up of from 3500 to 4500 small, whitish
spheres, which represent the undeveloped ova, and which in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>active state are developed, one by one, into yolks with their blastoderms.
From the blastoderm the fetus may later be developed.
In the active ovary of the laying hen the ovarian mass is of considerable
size, as it contains ova in different stages of development.
Only one ovum is completely developed at a time, though occasionally
there may be only a few hours between the maturity of successive
ova. The ova receives nourishment from the blood-vessels
of the capsule, which vessels are branches of the ovarian artery.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The ovary contains very vascular cellulofibrous tissue.
The ovum as it develops is attached to the ovarian body by means
of a delicate white fibrous pedicle. When the yolk is mature
it escapes from the enveloping fibrous capsule by a cleavage of
the capsule. The cleavage line is called the <i>stigmen</i> (Fig. 56, No.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>2). The yolk is surrounded by a very delicate membrane called the
<i>vitelline membrane</i>. The empty sac now shrinks and finally
disappears.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Egg.</b>—The principal divisions of the egg are the yolk, the
albumin outside of the yolk content, the shell membranes and the
shell (Fig. 58). As stated, the <i>yolk</i> is formed in the ovary, leaving
the other three portions to be formed in the oviduct.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>albumin</i> may be subdivided into, first, a thin layer of albumin
lying close around the yolk; second, a thick layer of albumin lying
at the outer periphery; and third, a modification of the albumin
called the chalazæ. The chalazæ are twisted, dense cord-like
structures at either pole of the yolk, one end of which is adherent
to the vitelline membrane and the other to the inner membrane
surrounding the albumin. The chalazæ thus act as stays to this
structure, which is carrying a delicate burden, the blastoderm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The <i>shell membrane</i> consists of two layers, an inner delicate,
and an outer thicker layer. When the egg is just laid these two
membranes are in all parts closely adherent to each other, and the
egg content completely fills the shell cavity. As soon as the content
cools there is a slight contraction; the two shell membranes separate
at the large end of the egg, forming an air cell which gradually
enlarges as the evaporation of liquid through the pores of the shell
takes place.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The shell consists of several layers. Three are easily distinguishable:
first, an inner mammillary layer, consisting of minute conical
deposits of calcareous material; second, a middle spongy layer,
composed of a thick network of fibers; third, an outer delicate,
cuticle-like structure. In certain breeds of poultry a pigment
may be added; for example, in ducks a pea green, in turkeys a
spotted brownish material, and in fowls pink and various shades of
brown. The egg shell is porous to admit the free exchange of air
during the process of incubation.</p>

<p class='c007'>An average sized hen egg weighs about 2 ounces, of which 11
per cent. is shell, 32 per cent. yolk, and 57 per cent. white. The
principal chemical constituents of the egg are as follows: ash, or
mineral matter, 9 per cent.; fat, or hydrocarbon, 9.3 per cent.;
proteids, or nitrogenous matter, 11.9 per cent.; and water, 65.5
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>per cent. There is apparently no constant proportion of weight
between the yolk and albumin. There is also a variation in the
weight of the shell due to its variation in thickness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an examination of ten eggs of average size, the yolk constituted
31 per cent. of the total weight of the egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is the result of the analysis of twelve eggs of average
size. This analysis included the shell and all other parts taken

<p class='c007'><b>The Oviduct.</b>—The three separate and distinct portions of the
egg, albumin, shell membranes, and the shell, are constructed in
different parts of the oviduct.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Location.</i>—The oviduct of the hen extends along the left side of the
bodies of the vertebræ, and the roof of the pelvic cavity and lies
dorsal to the abdominal air-sac. It extends from the posterior
border of the ovary and empties into the cloaca (Fig. 56, No. 3 and
8) through a transverse slit.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—In a well-developed Plymouth Rock pullet, but one
whose reproductive organs have never become active, the oviduct
is about 4½ inches long; in the fully developed and active state it
is from 18 to 20 inches long, and in a collapsed state about ½ inch
in diameter. It is held in position by two ligaments, a dorsal and
a ventral (Fig. 55, <i>B</i>) to be described later. The oviduct is tortuous
in its course, forming three principle convolutions before reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the cloaca, and like the ovarian mass, in its active state, pushes
the abdominal viscera downward and toward the right side.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The oviduct consists of three coats: first, the serous,
located on the outside, which is a reflection of the peritoneum;
second, the muscular middle tunic; third, the mucous coat, which
in a resting state is thrown into folds.</p>

portion, or uterus, and the vagina (Fig. 59).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>funnel</i> is the trumpet-shaped portion, the ostium tubæ
abdominale, whose mouth or fimbriated opening faces the ovary,
and lies ventrally to receive the ovum, or yolk, as it is discharged
from the ovary. Its thin wall, expanded in the anterior portion,
is provided with fimbriæ-like projections. This funnel-shaped
portion soon converges to form a constricted portion. This portion
of the active oviduct is from 3 to 4 centimeters long. The
mucous membrane occurs in folds forming low longitudinal spiral
ridges (Fig. 60, <i>A</i>). The fimbriæ are continuous with the dorsal
and the ventral ligament of the oviduct; and from this point,
where the ridges of the mucous membrane are almost nil, they
gradually increase in height as they extend down the tube. These
ridges are continued in those of the second, or albumin-secreting
portion (Fig. 60, <i>D</i>). At this point they increase in height very
rapidly. Here the bundles of muscular fibers of the middle coat
are thin and distributed among bundles of connective tissue. The
muscular fibers consist of two layers, an outer longitudinal and an
inner circular. At places in this portion the inner bundles may
be noted to extend longitudinally. In embryological development
the epithelial layer has an origin different from the outer layers of
the oviduct. In the fetal development the Müllerian duct arises
as a thickening along the Wolffian body just ventral to the gonad.
This Müllerian duct is at first a solid cord of cells. It later develops
a lumen, and grows posteriorly until it connects with the cloaca.
At the time of this posterior growth, mesenchyme cells migrate
in from the surrounding tissue and form a layer about the duct.
From this layer of mesenchyme cells there are developed the outer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>layers of the oviduct, which layers later develop the muscular
structure and the connective tissue. The epithelium and its
derivatives, which represent the glandular structures, are formed
from the walls of the old Müllerian duct. Thus the two sets of
tissues, having different origins, likewise have different functions.
The epithelium is concerned entirely with secretion, and the derivatives
of the mesenchyme are concerned
with supporting and muscular
function.</p>

<p class='c007'>To summarize, six layers of tissue
occur in the funnel region, namely,
an outer serous covering, an outer
longitudinal muscular layer, a layer
of connective tissue, an inner circular
layer, a second layer of connective
tissue, and an inner mucous layer.
The mucous layer is made up of
glands, as follows. The unicellular
glands occur between the ciliated
cells of the epithelium. These glands
are found only in the posterior half
of this division of the oviduct. The
glandular grooves are made up of an
accumulation of gland cells at the
bottom of the grooves between the
secondary folds of the epithelium.
These are found in all parts of this
division except the extreme posterior
part. In the posterior part we find
the third type of glands, the tubular
variety.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second division of the oviduct,
as stated above, is the <i>albumin-secreting portion</i>. The funnel division
gradually merges into the second portion. These two portions
are distinguishable from each other. The walls of the albumin-secreting
portion are much thicker and the longitudinal ridges are
higher. This section is the longest of the five divisions, measuring
from 40 to 42 centimeters in length, or more than half the length
of the oviduct. The albumin division terminates rather abruptly
into the third division, the isthmus (Fig. 59, <i>A</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>It is probable that the secretion of albumin is not confined to the
cells of the second division; yet we are safe in saying that the major
portion is formed here. The folds of mucous membrane in this division
are thicker and higher than in the funnel, due to their containing
cells of the high columnar type, and to the fuller development
of the glands which are of the tubular variety. The muscular layer
is heavier, and therefore the muscular power to force along the
tubes’ contents is greater. In the formation of the mucous folds we
find, in transverse sections, that the central core is made up of connective
tissue which carries blood-vessels and nerve filaments, as
in other similar glandular structure. The epithelium contains glandular
cells of two varieties, namely, the ciliated, columnar variety,
and the unicellular, goblet variety (Fig. 36, No. <i>B</i>, 2). These two
kinds of glandular cells are rather evenly distributed throughout the
epithelium of this section of the oviduct. The unicellular gland cells
are more numerous at the mouths of the ducts leading from the tubular
glands. The nuclei of the ciliated cells are oval and lie near
the middle of the cells or a trifle toward the base from the middle.
The protoplasm of the cells is finely granular. Strong cilia in considerable
number surmount each cell. In some cases the goblet or
mucous cells have pushed apart the ciliated cells, and their prolongations
extend farther than the surface of the ciliated cells. The
nuclei of the goblet cells are round, and lie nearer the proximal
end than those of the ciliated cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third division of the oviduct, the <i>isthmus</i>, continues from the
albumin-secreting portion and terminates in the expanded portion
called by some anatomists, the uterus. Toward the posterior
end of the albumin-secreting portion the longitudinal folds of mucous
membrane become lower, making, at the juncture of this and
the isthmus, a clear fine of demarcation. For a distance of 2
or 3 centimeters the folds are low, after which they gradually
become higher, but never reach the height or thickness of those in
the albumin-secreting portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clear-cut line between the albumin-secreting portion and
the isthmus is partly due to a zone in which the long tubular glands
are lacking. The core of the folds of mucous membrane in this
zone contain much more connective tissue. The cells are both
ciliated and unicellular. The rest of the histological structure of
the isthmus is the same as that of the albumin-secreting portion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The function of the isthmus is to secrete, or to form, the shell
membrane, the membrana testacea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth division of the oviduct is the <i>uterus</i>, or the shell-gland
portion (Fig. 60, <i>C</i>). There is no clear line of demarcation between
the isthmus and shell-gland portion, the walls gradually expanding.
In this region the folds of mucous membrane become leaf-like and of
considerable length, extending into the lumen, thus affording a
greater cellular surface. The same coats of the duct are present
here as in other parts; but the outer longitudinal muscular layer is
thicker and possesses more strength. The quantity of connective
tissue is about the same. The glands are of a tubular type and the
same two varieties of epithelial cells are found here as elsewhere,
namely, the ciliated high columnar and the unicellular mucous
variety.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the active glandular cells of the shell-forming region the nuclei
are small, dark staining, and lie toward the center of the cell. The
chromatin granules and nucleoli take on a comparatively deep basic
stain, but they do not show the intense stain found in the albumin
and the isthmus region. The cytoplasm of the uterine tubular
glands does not present as heavy a granular appearance as that of
the albumin portion. These cells are diffusely granular, the granules
appearing of one size and taking the stain faintly. The function
of this portion is to secrete, or form, the hard calcareous covering
which has been described at the beginning of this section.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fifth division of the oviduct is the <i>vagina</i>. There is located,
at the juncture of the shell-gland portion with the vagina, a strong
sphincter muscle. The vagina is that constricted portion of the
oviduct extending from this muscle to the cloaca. The mucous
membrane forms low narrow folds with secondary folds, which
appear continuous with those of the shell-gland portion. The core
of these folds is composed of connective tissue. The vagina in
the hen of average size measures from 12 to 13 centimeters long
(Surface). The inner or circular muscular layer is well developed;
it is much thicker than in any other part of the oviduct. This
extra development gives the power necessary to successfully expel
the egg. The outer longitudinal layer is not so well developed; its
bundles are scattered throughout the connective-tissue layers. The
egg is caused to move along in the oviduct by a successive series of
contractions of the circular muscular fibers posterior to it. There
are no tubular glands in this portion, but a simple layer of high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>ciliated columnar epithelium, and some goblet, or mucous cells.
The cells on the surface generally are long and slender; in the grooves
between the mucous folds the cells are shortest, reaching their
greatest length at the tops of the folds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The function of the vagina is the secretion, or formation, of the
outer shell cuticle commonly called the bloom, and also in certain
breeds, as indicated above, the tint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cloaca furnishes a passage way from the vagina to the external
world by way of the anus. The walls of the cloaca contain
glands.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Ligaments of the Oviduct.</b>—It is held in position by two
ligaments, one dorsal and one ventral. The <i>dorsal ligament</i> of the
oviduct is formed by a double layer of peritoneum with a very
small amount of connective tissue interposed. The peritoneum is
also reflected over the oviduct. The ventral ligament of the oviduct
is narrower than the dorsal, but is similarly constructed. Both
ligaments are rather veil-like in appearance. During the first four
or five months of the growth of the young female fowl the development
of the oviduct and its ligaments is in proportion to that of the
body. With the elongation that takes place about the time of functionation,
as described above, the ligaments enlarge in proportion
to the enlargements of the oviduct. The dorsal ligament maintains
a line of attachment to the body wall from the caudal end of the body
cavity to the fourth thoracic rib. The ventral ligament elongates
only slightly during this developing period. It becomes thicker
and stronger and early develops a muscular coat. It also grows in
width except at the caudal end. At this point the ligament is
simply a mass of muscular tissue of the smooth or involuntary type.
These ligaments are fan-shaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>The muscle fibers of the dorsal ligament of the laying hen, have
their origin in a line near the medial side of the dorsal margin. At
this point the bundles of fibers are quite thick, but are spread out
thinly toward the margin of the oviduct. Frequent anastomoses are
noted. The muscular fibers become continuous with the circular
ones of the oviduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ventral ligament</i> of the oviduct of the laying hen is largely a
muscular cord 3 to 6 centimeters in diameter. The caudal end
is thicker, becoming gradually thinner toward the anterior portion.
The bundles of muscular fibers extend toward the oviduct blending
with the circular fibers of that viscus. The ligaments terminate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>anteriorly in such a manner that they aid in forming the serous
ovarian pocket, which guides the yolk into the fimbriated portion,
or funnel, of the oviduct. The walls of the ovarian pocket are
formed by the left abdominal air-sac, a part of the intestine, and
the mesentery. The dorsal portion is formed by the roof of the
abdominal cavity, and the ventral portion is formed by the dorsal
wall of the air-sac. The medial, the anterior, and the lateral limit
of the pocket are formed by a fusion of the wall of the air-sac to
the mesentery and to the body wall. Posteriorly, the wall consists
of the transverse part of the small intestine and the caudal portion
of the left cæcum with their attached mesentery.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE DUCTLESS GLANDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These glands do not possess excretory ducts. They furnish
materials which are added to the blood or lymph as it passes through
them. The material from each gland is known as an internal secretion,
or hormone. Some of these secretions are powerful materials
and influence profoundly the body nutrition. The ductless
glands are usually given as follows: the spleen, the lymph glands,
the pineal gland, the pituitary body, the thyroid gland, the thymus
gland, the adrenal glands, and the parathyroids. The spleen, the
pituitary, the pineal, and the lymph glands are described in other
sections.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Thyroid Gland</b> (Fig. 21, No. 16). <i>Location.</i>—The thyroid
gland lies on the ventral side of the carotis communis at a point
where the carotis communis touches the jugular vein, which is about
the point of origin of the vertebral artery.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The thyroid gland is small, oval or somewhat roundish,
and red or rose-colored.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The thyroid gland has a fibrous capsule, which sends
into the interior septa which divide it into acini. These acini are
closed and contain a fluid. The thyroid is a ductless gland. Short
arteries from the carotis enter this gland, and some large veins connect
it with the jugular vein. The lymph vessels which lie along the
neck are closely connected with it and receive twigs from the gland.
The minute lymphatic capillary endings are found in its septa and in
its capsule. The acini are lined with a single or a double row of
cuboidal secreting cells. There are two kinds of cells, namely,
secreting and resting cells. The actively secreting cells secrete
colloid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>parathyroids</b> consist of two small bodies attached to the
lower pole of the thyroid.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Thymus Gland</b> (Fig. 47, No. 10).—The thymus gland is an
organ of fetal and early baby chickhood. It soon undergoes retrogressive
changes into fat and connective tissue. It is of epithelial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>origin, being formed in fetal life from the entodermal cells of the dorsal
end of the throat fissure.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Location.</i>—The thymus gland lies anterior to the thyroid, the
latter lying the deeper.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—The thyroid consists of two lobes, which are united by
connective tissue, and appears as a loop-like acinous gland lying
along the neck and near the region of the bronchi and the jugular
veins with fibrous extensions toward the head.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The gland lobes are divided into lobules, which consist
of a cortical and a medullary portion. The cortex consists
of nodules of compact lymphatic tissue similar to those found in the
lymph glands. These occupy the chambers formed by the septa
of connective tissue. In the medulla there are a number of spherical,
or oval bodies composed of concentrically arranged epithelial cells.
These are known as Hassall’s corpuscles, and represent only the
remains of the original glandular epithelium. They are characteristic
of the thymus gland. The thymus appears to be a type of
lymph organ. Lymph vessels are rare; a few blood-vessels on the
upper side form capillary nets.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Adrenal Gland</b> (Fig. 54, <i>F</i>). <i>Location.</i>—The adrenal gland,
often called the suprarenal capsule, lies just anterior to the front
part of the anterior lobe of the kidney, adjacent to the testicles in
the male and to the ovary in the female. It is loosely attached by
connective tissue to the posterior aorta and to the vena cava.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Shape.</i>—It is yellowish-brown or reddish-pink in color, small,
and of irregular formation.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Structure.</i>—The adrenal gland consists of a cortical and a medullary
portion, although these two parts are not distinctly marked.
The cortical portion has columns which extend deeply into the gland,
and the medullary portion sends columns into the cortical portion.
Therefore, the two substances, lying side by side, form a cord-like
structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that the cortical portion is derived from the ingrowths
of the peritoneum, and the medullary cords from the sympathetic
ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cells are cylindrical or polygonal in shape, with an eccentric
substance between the columns. The cords, or columns, form between
them, elongated channels which extend into the interior of
the gland and end as blind or cæcal extremities. Large ganglionic
nerve cells belonging to the sympathetic system occur near the surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of the gland. The blood-vessels are not well developed in the
interior of the gland but are numerous and of good size in the outer
parts. Lymph vessels are also present.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Function.</i>—The adrenals are ductless glands. They secrete an
internal secretion, or hormone, which influences the tonus of the
blood-vessels. An extract from these glands is called adrenalin.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE RESPIRATORY APPARATUS (Figs. 50 and 61, <i>A</i>)</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Owen says: “Notwithstanding the extent and activities of the
respiratory function in birds, the organs subservient thereto manifest
more of a reptilian than of the mammalian type of formation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By the action of the respiratory organs certain chemical and
physical changes take place in the blood. The chief of these consists
in absorption of oxygen from, and giving off carbon dioxide
to, the atmospheric air, the former changes being necessary for the
elaboration of the fluid, the latter for the elimination of a substance
which, if retained, would prove injurious. The organs of respiration
are invariably adapted to the wants of the animal and the medium
in which it lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the bird, which breathes through its nose, the organs of respiration
are nostrils, nasal chambers, pharynx, superior larynx, trachea,
inferior larynx, bronchi, bronchial tubes, lungs, and air-sacs.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Nostrils and the Nasal Chambers.</b>—The nostrils of the bird
open externally by two small elliptical openings, which pierce the
upper mandible. Within each nasal chamber (Fig. 26, <i>A</i>) are three
turbinated laminæ, or <i>turbinated bones</i>. The inferior one is a simple
fold adhering to the lower and anterior part of the nasal septum.
The middle turbinated bone is the largest. It is of infundibular
form, and adheres by its base to the septum and externally to the
side wall of the nose. It is convoluted with two and a half turns.
The superior bone, of bell shape, adheres superiorly to the frontal
bone. The internal turbinated bone extends toward the orbit;
the external terminates in a cul-de-sac behind the middle turbinal
(Fig. 26, No. <i>A</i>, 1 and 2, and <i>G</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The nostrils are separated by a partition which is partly bony and
partly cartilaginous. The posterior nares is represented by a long
slit in the hard palate.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Pharynx and the Superior Larynx.</b>—A transverse row of
horny, filiform papillæ marks the anterior border of the pharynx,
where in other animals the soft palate, or velum, is located. (For
further description of the pharynx see special chapter.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The supero-posterior border of the larynx, at the juncture of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>larynx and the esophageal margin, is marked by a second transverse
row of horny, filiform papillæ, which point backward. There is
no epiglottis. The superior part of the larynx is pierced by an oval,
slit-like opening, the <i>glottis</i>, which is provided with two lips. These
when brought together, tightly close the glottis so that nothing can
fall through into the larynx in the act of deglutition. The margin,
or rim, of this opening is called the <i>rami glottis</i>. The glottis is controlled
by two pair of muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superior surface of the larynx is somewhat triangular with the
apex directed forward. A few delicate, filiform papillæ are upon
its surface. The bird has, as already indicated, two larynxes, the
<i>superior larynx</i> located at the upper end of the trachea, and the
<i>inferior larynx</i> at the bifurcation of the trachea. The inner surface
of the superior larynx is smooth and does not contain vocal
cords; it is in these animals simply a passage for air. It is joined
to the trachea inferiorly by a ligament, the <i>crico-trachealis</i>, and lies
at the base of the tongue supported by two cornua of the os hyoideum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cartilages forming the principal support of the superior larynx,
consist of four pieces, as follows: one unequal ventral piece, two side
pieces, and one unequal dorsal piece. The cartilaginous, flat,
ventral <i>cricoid</i>, early in the bird’s life, often becomes bony. The
side pieces are separated from it, only exceptionally fusing with it.
The dorsal cricoid piece also often becomes bony. The two <i>arytenoid
cartilages</i>, joined with the cricoid superiorly, are three-sided,
and are united to each other in a sharp angle. They form the superior
opening of the superior larynx.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Trachea.</b>—The trachea is cylindrical and varies in length in
different kinds of birds in accordance with the length of the neck.
It consists of from 90 to 120 cartilaginous rings, complete with the
exception of the two uppermost, which rings are held together by
intercartilaginous ligaments. The tracheal rings are constructed
of hyaline cartilage and the ligaments of fibrous tissue. It is lined
with a mucous membrane covered by columnar epithelium. The
trachea is a passage for air alone and terminates in the inferior
larynx.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Inferior Larynx.</b>—The inferior larynx, called the <i>true larynx</i>
because it is the organ of voice, is located at the inferior end of the
trachea and the superior ends of the bronchi. By some anatomists
this organ has been called the <i>larynx broncho-trachealis</i>. The larynx
is flattened laterally in fowls. It contains two membranous folds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>which in the production of sound are caused to vibrate. These folds
are half-moon shaped elastic structures, located in the bony, arrowlike
way, intero-inferiorly. These structures are called the <i>membrana
tympana interna</i>. In the duck this inferior larynx is represented by
a drum-like cartilaginous and bony structure, called the <i>bulla tympaniformis</i>.
This bulla is a resonant apparatus which serves to
strengthen the voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>In song birds there is a double glottis, usually produced by a
bony bar, called the <i>pessulus</i>, or <i>os transversale</i>, which traverses the
lower end of the trachea from front to rear. It supports a thin
membrane which ascends into the tracheal area, and, terminating
there by a free concave margin, is called the <i>membrana semi-lunaris</i>.
This is most developed in singing birds, and being vibratile, forms
an important part of their trilling vocal apparatus. The air passes
on each side of the membrana semi-lunaris and its sustaining bone to
and from the bronchi and lungs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last ring of the trachea usually expands as it descends, with
its fore and posterior parts produced, and the lower lateral borders
concave; the extremities of the pessulus, butts against the angle
thus formed and expands to be attached, also with the fore and posterior
terminations of the first half ring of the bronchus, strengthening
and clamping together the upper part of the vocal framework.
The second bronchial half ring is flattened and curved with the convexity
outward, like the first, but is more movable. The third
half ring is less curved and further separated from the second, to
the extremities of which its own are connected by a ligament, and,
for the intervening extent, by a membrane; its inner surface supports
the fibrous cord, or fold, which forms the outer lip of the glottis
of that side; it is capable of rotary movements on its axis, and is
an important agent in the modulation of the voice. All these
parts just described are bony.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Bronchi and the Lungs.</b>—The bronchi, two in number,
are provided with only incomplete cartilaginous rings. They enter
the inferior face of the lungs, toward their anterior and middle
thirds and break up into primary bronchi, which give off at right
angles, secondary bronchi, and these latter in turn give off tertiary
branches.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The lungs occupy only about one-seventh of the thoracic space.
They are long, flattened, and oval, extending along each side of the
spine from the second dorsal vertebra to the anterior end of the kidneys,
and laterally to the juncture of the vertebral with the sternal
portions of the ribs. They present two faces, a <i>superior convex</i> and
an <i>inferior concave</i>; two borders, an <i>external</i> and an <i>internal</i>; and two
extremities, an <i>anterior</i> and a <i>posterior</i> (Fig. 61). The convex surface
is also called the dorsal, costal, or superior face. It is moulded
on the walls of the thorax and occupies a part of the intercostal
space, pushing the intercostal muscles outward. When the surface
of the lung is examined it is seen to be furrowed where the ribs
pressed during life. These furrows are as deep as the ribs are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>thick. The sides of the lungs are covered with connective tissue
which attaches them to the costal walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The concave, or inferior, face also called the <i>diaphragmatic</i> or
<i>visceral face</i> is directed downward. The diaphragm separates it
from the abdominal viscera. The surface is covered by connective
tissue which closely attaches it to the diaphragm. It is perforated
by the five tubules which bring the posterior air-sac into communication
with the lungs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The borders of the lungs extend parallel to the long axis of the
body. The internal border is rectilinear, thick, and rounded. The
external border is convex, thin, and sharp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior extremity terminates in a sharp point which occupies
a space formed by the ribs externally and the inferior spines internally.
The posterior extremity is somewhat rounded and extends
as far back as the anterior border of the kidneys.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the bronchi enter the lungs they become broadened,
the cartilaginous rings disappear, and they continue as membranous
channels whose diameters gradually decrease, as they extend backward,
to the point where they terminate in the <i>ostium caudale</i>, at
which point they are surrounded by a cartilaginous ring. The
ostium caudale brings the tubules into communication with the
ventral air-sacs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twelve <i>air tubules</i> have their origin from each common bronchus,
or trunk. Four are given off from the internal wall of the main
bronchus by a series of openings arranged in a row. Seven are given
off from the external wall by a second series similar to that of the
first. The twelfth extends from the inferior wall, and immediately
takes a course downward and outward and communicates with the
posterior diaphragmatic air-sac. This may be considered as the
terminal branch of the trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of these secondary canals, except the last, pass toward the
periphery of the lung. They divide and subdivide at the periphery,
covering it with their ramifications. The canals extending from the
inner wall are distributed to the inferior face of the lung. Those
extending from the outer wall are distributed to the outer face of the
lung. The first constitute the <i>diaphragmatic</i> and the second the
<i>costal bronchial tubes</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four <i>diaphragmatic bronchial tubes</i> are numbered in the order
in which they are given off. The first is carried forward horizontally,
the second transversely inward, the third obliquely inward and backward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and the fourth directly backward. They have, by some
anatomists, been called the anterior, the internal, and the posterior
diaphragmatic bronchial tubes. There are two posterior
diaphragmatic bronchial tubes; the larger called the great posterior,
and the smaller, which passes directly backward, the small
posterior.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>costal bronchial tubes</i>, seven in number, are numbered from
the front backward in the order they are given off. Parallel at
their origin, and side by side, like pipes of an organ, they soon spread
out in fan-shape like the preceding. They extend from their central
origin to the periphery. The first extends obliquely upward
and inward to the anterior extremity of the lung. All branches
from this bronchus extend from its anterior wall. The first branches
are inflected to reach the external border of the lung. The succeeding
branches are directed forward and the last forward and inward.
They all meet those from the anterior diaphragmatic bronchus,
but do not anastomose with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second, the third, and the fourth costal bronchi extend in a
transverse manner and ramify on the inner border of the lung.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fifth and the sixth are directed toward the posterior extremity
of the lung. The seventh, very small, reaches this extremity, where
it disappears.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first costal bronchus is the largest; those following it gradually
become smaller. At their points of origin they adhere closely to
the ribs. They are all imperforate, which is a distinguishing feature
from those occupying the opposite face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>canaliculi</i> or <i>tertiary tubules</i> given off by these secondary
bronchial tubes do not differ greatly in caliber in the various parts.
They are given off at right angles from the pulmonary wall of each
bronchus, and extend perpendicularly into the lung substance.
Thus we find three kinds of conduits, the primary, the secondary,
and the peripheral, or tertiary. The first are like the barbs of a
feather on its shaft; and the second and parenchymatous are implanted
on the pulmonary walls of the first, like the hairs of a
brush on their common base. Thus instead of the branching of
the bronchi being dichrotomous, as in mammals, it is piniform.</p>

<p class='c007'>The canaliculi, or finer tubules, communicate with one another.
The inner microscopic appearance of the canaliculi indicate that
they are divided into areola, which gives them a cellular aspect.
These tertiary bronchi open on a dense labyrinth of blood capillaries

<p class='c007'><b>The Air-sacs</b> (Fig. 61, <i>A</i>).—The air-sacs are bladder-like structures

vessels of the general circulation and not extensions from those of
the lungs. No lymphatics have been found in the air-sacs.</p>

<p class='c007'>These sacs do not communicate with each other and normally
they are not fully inflated. In some locations they extend into the
bones and are in communication with the extensions of the bronchial
tubes. In fact, by some anatomists they have been called “bladder-like,
extra-pulmonary expansions of the bronchial tubes, free from
cartilage.” The air-sacs make the bird’s body lighter, thus making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>long-continued flight possible. They are best developed in those
birds which fly most. There are four pairs of cells and one single
cell from which all other expansions and extensions are made.
These sacs are as follows: a single anterior thoracic, and, in pairs,
cervical, anterior diaphragmatic, posterior diaphragmatic, and
abdominal.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Anterior Thoracic Air-sac.</i>—The anterior thoracic air-sac is
located above the clavicles and the interclavicular space, in the
cavity of the thorax. It is related superiorly with the trachea and
the esophagus; laterally with the lungs and the cervical air-sacs;
inferiorly with the sternum, the clavicle, and the interclavicular
aponeurosis; posteriorly with the heart and the anterior diaphragmatic
reservoir; and anteriorly with the integuments of the neck.
It contains the inferior larynx and the two primary bronchi, and
large vascular trunks from which are given off vessels supplying the
neck and the wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three prolongations, called subpectoral, subscapular, and middle,
or humeral, arise from the lateral walls of this air-sac. These
prolongations cross the walls of the thorax and pass around the
articulation of the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>subpectoral prolongation</i> extends from the thoracic reservoir
by an orifice situated behind the coracoid, and passes beneath the
tendon of the great pectoral muscle. When the pectoralis major
contracts, this contraction dilates the subjacent cell and draws into
it a greater quantity of air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>subscapular</i> and the <i>humeral prolongations</i> communicate with
the thoracic air cell by a common opening situated behind the small
adductor muscle of the humerus. The subscapular prolongation,
after leaving this point, spreads under the scapular and the subscapular
muscle, which it separates from the ribs and corresponding
intercostal muscles, and extends in a longitudinal direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The humeral prolongation, smaller than the subscapular, occupies
the axilla, and is in shape triangular. It has from its summit into
an infundibular fossa, an extension which enters the canal of the
humerus. The walls of this cell form the lining of the air space in
the humerus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thoracic air-sac thus possesses numerous membranous folds
which divide its cavity. The contiguous structures which it overlies,
as the trachea, the esophagus, the muscles of the inferior larynx,
as well as the arteries and veins, make its outer walls irregular.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>This orifice is dilated during inspiration, by the contraction of the
two first fasciculi of the diaphragm.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Cervical Air-sacs.</i>—The two cervical air-sacs are located just
above the thoracic air-sac at the inferior part of the neck and in
front of the lungs. They are cone-shaped with the base directed
forward and the apex backward. They are related superiorly with
the cervical muscles, and inferiorly with the thoracic air-sac from
which they are separated by the trachea, the esophagus, the pneumogastric
nerve, and the jugular veins. The walls touch each
other internally, and form a median septum which includes in
its substance the two common carotid arteries. Externally they
are related to the origin of the cervical nerves, to each of which they
contribute a small sheath. They surround the vertebral artery,
and are connected with the subcutaneous muscles and the skin.
The summits communicate with the anterior diaphragmatic bronchus.
Prolongations extend from their bases which conduct the air
into all the vertebræ of the neck and the back, into all the vertebral
ribs, and into the spinal canal. Parallel with and adjacent to the
vertebral arteries, and lodged in the canals excavated in the transverse
processes of the cervical vertebræ, are two cervical prolongations,
one on each side, which extend to the cranium from the base
of the cervical reservoirs. From their sides, at the last six cervical
vertebræ, are six extensions in the form of diverticuli, which,
lying against each other, pass from each side into the muscles of the
neck. They are surrounded by a thin fibrous envelope, a continuation
of the mucous lining of the sac, and apparently form a canal in
the inferior part of this region. These prolongations are better
developed in palmipedes than in chickens. On the internal side
of these prolongations, one or more foramina penetrate the vertebral
segment, which allow the extensions of the prolongations into the
spinal canal. Chauveau states that “as the medullary tissue is
replaced by air in the bones of birds, so is the subarachnoid fluid
replaced by air around the spinal cord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The prolongations extending from the cervical air-sacs, having
entered the thorax, terminate by passing into the first dorsal vertebra.
After permeating every part of this vertebra, it escapes by a
lateral opening and forms a small sac located between the first two
ribs, near the origin of the first dorsal nerve. From this sac an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>extension is given off, which enters the second vertebral segment at
the antero-lateral part; from this point it passes back, forming a
new air-sac between the second and third ribs. It now passes in
the same manner into the third vertebra and extends through the
third intercostal sac, and so on till the last dorsal vertebra has been
served. At the same time that these sacs receive the air from the
vertebræ preceding them, and transmit it to those which follow,
they communicate it to all the vertebral ribs. The aerial currents
which leave the cervical air-sacs do not communicate with those
of the cranium. Experiments show that the cranial bones have
apparently no communication with the respiratory apparatus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Anterior Diaphragmatic Air-sac.</i>—The two anterior diaphragmatic
or supero-posterior air-sacs are related with the lungs
anteriorly, and with the abdominal viscera posteriorly. Anteriorly
also is the thoracic air-sac, posteriorly are the posterior diaphragmatic
air-sacs, and laterally the ribs and the intercostal muscles
and internally is the esophagus. The lungs communicate with these
air-sacs through circular openings from the great posterior diaphragmatic
bronchus and frequently by a second opening from this same
tube. These are the only sacs which receive air from the lungs
through two openings.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Posterior Diaphragmatic Air-sac.</i>—The two posterior diaphragmatic,
or infero-posterior air-sacs are oval in shape and located
between the thoracic and the abdominal cavity. They are related
anteriorly with the anterior diaphragmatic air-sacs. These two
sacs form a vertical transverse partition. The posterior diaphragmatic
air-sacs are related posteriorly with the abdominal air-sacs
from which they are separated by the diaphragm. They are
related below with the lateral parts of the sternum and the sternal
ribs, and externally with the ribs and the intercostal muscles.
These air-sacs communicate with the lungs through openings located
in the middle part of the external border of the lung, into the
extremity of voluminous bronchial tubes which follow the direction
of the largest air tubes.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Abdominal Air-sacs.</i>—The two abdominal air-sacs located
on each side of the abdominal cavity, when inflated with air, form
enormous bladder-like structures. They are related laterally with
the abdominal wall and internally with the abdominal viscera. The
anterior extremities are in communication with the mesobronchi
and are somewhat inflected to pass under the fibrous arches extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>from the spine to the pelvis. Anteriorly these sacs adjoin the
diaphragm, the testes in the male, and ovary in the female, and to
the parietes of the abdomen and those of the pelvis. Below and in
front, they rest on a fibrous septum, which in all birds divides the
abdominal cavity into two smaller cavities: one anterior, representing
the abdomen and containing the liver; the other posterior,
representing the pelvis and containing the gizzard and the intestines.
The anterior portion overlies the posterior part of the lobes of the
liver, the proventriculus, the spleen, and the gizzard. The kidneys
are located above these air-sacs. Dorsal to the sacs is also a part of
the intestines and in the female the oviduct. The abdominal air-sacs
are attached by a ligament-like structure in their medial, their
anterior, and their lateral margin. The posterior, the dorsal, and
the ventral margin are free. Mesially this attachment is to the
mesentery, connecting the left cæcum to the dorsal margin of the
gizzard, and also to the mesentery of the proventriculus. The
anterior attachment is to the body wall and extends in front of the
end of the ovary and the adrenal glands. At the antero-lateral part
of the body cavity the attachment extends in a widening band along
the lateral side of the ovary and of the oviduct, as far back as the
caudal margin of the sac. The lateral attachment is related to
the kidney, the dorsal ligament of the oviduct, and the abdominal
wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of these abdominal sacs has three extensions: one suprarenal
and two femoral.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>suprarenal extension</i> leaves the principal sac at the postero-external
part of the kidney, extends upward, and forward, and
expands over the surface of the kidney. At the internal border of
the kidney, this prolongation extends between the transverse
processes of the sacral vertebræ, reaches a height of the first dorsal
vertebra, forms a triangular canal located above the sacrum in
the sacral channel, and is separated from its fellow by a series of
corresponding spinous processes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two <i>femoral extensions</i>, an anterior, small, and a posterior,
large, extend from the abdominal air-sac at the cotyloid cavity, leave
the pelvis through the bony passage occupied by the crural vessels,
extend around the coxo-femoral articulation, and terminate in a
blind extremity. In some birds, particularly in birds of prey and
ostriches, there are prolongations extending into the femur, entering
through a foramen at the anterior part of the great trochanter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span><i>Summary of Bones Supplied by Each Air-sac.</i>—The thoracic air-sac
communicates on each side of the thorax with twelve bones,
including the four sternal ribs. It supplies air to the clavicles, which
are perforated at both their extremities, and to the coracoids, which
are perforated just below their scapular extremity. The sternum
is supplied through two series of openings, the middle ones that
conduct air into the sternal ridge and the lateral ones, eight in
number and very small, correspond to the intercostal spaces. The
sternal ribs are penetrated by small foramina at their inferior extremities.
From the subscapular extension the scapulæ receive air
through one or two foramina at their anterior extremity. The
humeral prolongation supplies the humerus through a foramen
located at the upper edge of the humeral fossa, at the infero-internal
part of the articular head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cervical air-sac furnishes air to all the cervical vertebræ, to
all the dorsal vertebræ, and to all the vertebral ribs. The anterior
parts of the vertebræ of the neck are supplied with air through the
passage accommodating the vertebral artery. The posterior parts
of the vertebræ are supplied by extensions from the interspinal
canal. The first extensions obtain entrance to the anterior segments
by one or more openings of the inner wall of the intertransverse
canals; the median extensions penetrate the posterior segments
by two openings, a right and a left, situated on the inner wall
of those segments. The first dorsal vertebra is supplied with air
in the same manner, by the middle and the lateral canals of the
neck. This air, after passing through the first vertebra, leaves by
a lateral exit to enter a small air-sac. From this it passes into the
superior part of the second vertebra, escapes from this through its
lower portion, to be received into a lateral sac, and so on to the last
dorsal vertebra. These sacs also supply the vertebral ribs with
air, which enters them by very small openings located on their spinal
extremities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diaphragmatic air-sacs do not have communications with the
bones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abdominal air-sacs communicate with the sacrum, the
coccygeal vertebræ, the iliac bones, and the femurs. The air
passing through the sacrum, the coccyx, and the ilium comes directly
from the suprarenal extensions; the air which fills the femoral cavity
comes from the femoral extensions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some birds these air spaces are more greatly developed than in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>others. The bones that are always aerated in all birds are the
cervical and the dorsal vertebræ, the sternum, and the humeri.
Those aerated in some kinds only are the furculum, the scapulæ,
the vertebral and the sternal ribs, the sacrum, the coccyx, and the
femurs. Those that are never aerated are the bones of the forearm,
the hand, the leg, and the foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The service of air to the bones in most parts of the body by the
air-sacs, as just shown, is in special cases otherwise rendered. The
Eustachian tubes furnish air to the bones of the cranium and to the
upper jaw; while the lower jaw receives air from the pneumatic
foramen situated upon each ramus behind the tympanic articulation,
and from an air cell which surrounds the joint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cavities of the embryonic bones, which afterward become
pneumatic, are filled with marrow. Selenka states that the invasion
of the bones by the air is a late development, and that in the humerus
this invasion occurs after the twenty-second day in the life of the
chick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hunter and Compar, who have made extensive researches, consider
the function of the air-sacs as threefold.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the air-sacs are subsidiary respiratory organs, which aid
in ridding the blood of waste products and in taking in oxygen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, they aid mechanically the actions of respiration in birds.
During the act of inspiration the sternum is depressed, the angle
between the vertebral and the sternal ribs is made less acute, and
the thoracic cavity proportionately enlarged; the air then rushes
into the lungs and into the thoracic receptacles, while those
of the abdomen become flaccid. When the sternum is raised, or
approximated toward the spine, part of the air is expelled from the
lungs and the thoracic air-sac through the trachea, and part is
driven into the abdominal receptacles, which are thus alternately
enlarged and diminished with the expansion and the contraction of
the thorax. Hence the lungs, notwithstanding their fixed condition,
are subject to due compression through the medium of the contiguous
air receptacles, and are affected equally and regularly by every
motion of the sternum and of the ribs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third, they reduce decidedly the specific gravity of the whole
body. This must necessarily follow from the large spaces filled with
air as well as from the absence in the bones of marrow and other
fluids. The air-sacs by their position also render equilibrium more
stable.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ANGIOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>The Circulatory Apparatus.</b>—The circulatory apparatus consists of
two tubular systems: the blood vascular system and the lymphatic
system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blood vascular system consists of the heart, the arteries, the
veins, and the capillaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heart is the central, propelling organ. The arteries form a
series of efferent tubules, which, by branching, constantly increase
in number and decrease in caliber, and which serve to carry the
blood from the heart to the tissues. The capillaries are extensions
from these latter tubules into which the arteries empty, and through
the walls of which the interchange of elements between the blood
and the other tissues takes place. The veins form a system of
converging tubules which receive the blood from the capillaries,
decrease in number and increase in size as they approach the heart,
and return the blood to that organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymphatic system consists of capillaries and veins alone.
As in the blood system, the lymph capillaries collect the effete material
and pour it into the lymph veins, and these in turn, carry it to
the large blood veins adjacent to the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both these systems have one and the same continuous lining,
which consists of a single layer of endothelial cells. In the heart
this lining is called the endocardium, and in the vessels, the endothelium.
It forms a perfectly smooth surface.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE HEART (Fig. 21, No. 7)</h3>

<p class='c015'>The heart of the domestic fowl is located in the median line of
the thoracic cavity. It is more anterior and mesial than in mammals.
Its axis is parallel with the axis of the trunk. The lungs
being confined to the dorsal part of the trunk, the lower part of
the heart is not surrounded by them, but extends backward, the
apex resting in the anterior part of the anterior median fissure of the
liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heart has the form of an acute cone (Fig. 50, No. 1), the apex
of which is bluntly rounded.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>The heart is surrounded by a sero-fibrous sac, the <i>pericardium</i>.
This sac adheres to the cervical air reservoirs anteriorly and to the
diaphragmatic septum posteriorly. It is composed of two membranous
layers: the <i>parietal</i>, external, dense, and fibrous; and the
<i>visceral</i>, internal, and serous. The pericardial sac has no direct
attachment to the heart, except at the upper extremity where it
surrounds the large vessels emerging from it. The serous layer is
reflected over the outer portion of the heart, where it is called the
epicardium. The function of the pericardium is to prevent friction
during the beating of the heart. It contains a small amount of
serous fluid for perfect lubrication. This fluid is called the liquor
pericardii.</p>

<p class='c007'>Internally the heart has four cavities: two auricles and two
ventricles. The <i>right ventricle</i> is more crescent-shaped than in
solipedes, and in a manner envelops the left ventricle in front and to
the right, though it does not reach the point of the heart. The
<i>right auricle</i> is larger than the left. The <i>auriculo-ventricular</i> valve
is not tricuspid as in mammals. This valve instead of being formed
as usual by a membranous curtain, with margins retained by cords
fixed to the walls of the ventricles, is composed of a wide muscular
leaf, which appears to be a portion of the inner wall of the ventricle
detached from the <i>interventricular septum</i>. This septum is convex;
and the auriculo-ventricular orifice is an oblique slit situated between
it and the muscular valve in question; so that, when the heart wall
contracts at the systole, the valve is applied against this septum and
closes the passage. The bicuspid, or auriculo-ventricular valve of
the left side usually has two segments, though occasionally there
may be three. The <i>fossa ovalis</i> is a depression behind the posterior
semi-lunar valve in the septum of the heart. The membranous septum
closing the foramen ovale is complete and strong but thin and
transparent. The right auricle receives the blood from the two
venæ cavæ coming from the anterior extremity, and from the
posterior vena cava. These empty into a sinus. The left auricle
has two vessels, the pulmonary veins which bring blood to it from
the lungs.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Structure of the Heart.</b>—The heart is lined by a serous membrane,
the <i>endocardium</i>, which is a continuation of the endothelium of the
blood-vessels. There are a few muscular pillars in the inner wall,
called the <i>columnæ carnæ</i>. To give the heart its pumping power,
it is made up of contractile tissue, a specialized kind of muscle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>called <i>heart muscle</i>. It is involuntary-striated and occupies an
intermediate position, both morphologically and embryologically,
between smooth involuntary muscle and striated voluntary muscle
(Fig. 74, No. 4). It, like striated voluntary muscle, is both transversely
and longitudinally striated. Heart muscle cells are short,
thick cylinders, which are joined end to end to form long fibers. By
means of lateral branches the cells of one fiber anastomoses with
cells of adjacent fibers. Each cell of heart muscle contains one
centrally located nucleus. There is no distinct sarcolemma, but
the sarcoplasm is more dense near the surface of the cell, which
gives it the appearance of an enveloping cell wall. There is a
zone free from fibrillæ around the nucleus. The longitudinal
fibrillæ, which make up the cell, are held together by a cement-like
substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main mass of the heart wall, called <i>myocardium</i>, consists of
the specialized muscular tissue just described. The myocardium
differs in thickness in different parts of the heart wall. It is thickest
in the left ventricle and thinnest in the auricles. The left ventricle
forces the blood through the systemic circulation and hence must
be thicker to give it more power than is needed for the right ventricle,
which forces the blood only through the lungs. The auricles are
thinnest of all; for they receive the blood and pass it only to the
chambers below. The <i>auricular appendages</i> at the base of the heart
in fowls are not so well marked as in mammals. The auricular
muscles consist of an outer coat common to both auricles, the fibers
of which are transverse and of an inner coat, independent for each
auricle, the fibers of which are longitudinal. Between the two
coats, occur bundles of muscle the fibers of which run in various
directions. The disposition of the muscle tissue of the ventricles
is much more complicated. It is composed of several layers of
fibers intricately interwoven.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>endocardium</i>, covering the inner surface of the myocardium,
forms a serous lining of all the chambers of the heart. At the
arterial and venous openings it is continuous with and similar in
structure to the intima of the vessels. The endocardium consists
of two layers, an external layer closely attached to the myocardium
and consisting of mixed fibers, including those of elastic tissue and
smooth muscle cells; and an inner, single layer of endothelial cells,
spoken of above.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heart is supplied with nutrient blood by the two <i>coronary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>arteries</i>, which are given off from the common aorta just above the
semi-lunar valves.</p>

<p class='c007'>A right, or anterior, and a left, or posterior, coronary from their
point of origin, turn in a ventral direction between the root of the
aorta and the pulmonary artery, the right going to the right coronary
groove and the left to the left coronary groove in the crown furrow.
From here they send branches into the heart. The anterior, right,
coronary, or coronaria dextra, the larger, is given off from the
inferior wall of the aorta. It divides into a ramus superficialis
and a ramus profundus. The ramus superficialis enters the crown
furrow and divides into two or three branches on the right heart
wall. These branches extend to the apex of the heart. Twigs from
this artery along its course extend into the muscular wall reaching
the posterior of the coronary groove where they anastomose with
those of the left coronary, the ramus profundus, and with other
branches from the same artery. The ramus profundus, larger than
the preceding, gives off fine branches into the walls of the aorta and
of the pulmonary artery, then enters from behind into the right wall
of the septum ventriculorum, extends into the apex of the heart, and
supplies the septum, or right inner chamber wall with the last branch,
this breaking through the posterior wall of the auricular appendage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The posterior, <i>left coronary</i>, or <i>coronaria sinistra</i>, originates from
the dorsal wall of the aorta, proceeds as one branch on the upper
surface of the left auricular appendix, and then extends between the
left appendix and the pulmonary artery to the ventral surface of the
heart. On the left side it supplies the wall of the pulmonary artery
and gives off a ramus profundus. It sometimes divides into two
parts and supplies the ventral wall of the right chamber and then
extends to the left wall of the septum medium. The rest of the
coronaria sinistra enters into the left crown furrow as the ramus
superficialis, which provides the left and dorsal upper surface of
the left chamber to the apex. From this furrow it extends into the
left chamber and the left appendage, and finally fuses with the
ramus superficialis of the coronaria dextra.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE BLOOD-VESSELS</h3>

<p class='c015'>The blood-vessels consist of arteries, veins and capillaries.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Structure of the Capillaries and Arteries.</b>—The capillaries
are minute vessels which connect the <i>arterioles</i>, or terminal arteries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>with the <i>venules</i>, or terminal veins. They are only from 6 to 14
microns in diameter. Their walls consist of a single layer of
endothelial cells, which are somewhat elongated in the long axis
of the vessels. Their edges are serrated, and are united by a small
amount of intercellular cement-like substance. Capillaries branch
without diminution in caliber, and these branches anastomose to
form capillary networks, the meshes of which differ in size and shape
in different tissues and organs. The largest meshed networks occur
in the serous membranes and in the muscles; and the smallest occur
in the glands, such as the liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>walls of the arteries</i> are thick and stand open when empty,
owing to the elastic tissue contained in their walls, while the walls
of the veins collapse when empty, owing to their containing a smaller
amount of elastic tissue. The arterial wall is provided with three
coats: <i>tunica intima</i>, or inner coat; <i>tunica media</i>, or median coat;
and <i>tunica adventitia</i>, or outer coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>tunica intima</i> consists of a single layer of endothelial cells,
continuous with and similar to that forming the walls of the capillaries.
In passing from the capillaries to the arterioles, there is first
a thin coat, or sheath-like layer, of connective tissue around the
outside of the endothelial tubes. Further along, isolated smooth
muscle cells arranged in a circular manner occur between the endothelial
layer and the layer of connective tissue, this structure
forming vessels called precapillary arteries. Further along still,
the muscle cells form a complete layer; in this section the vessels
are called arterioles and are made up of three coats: the inner endothelial,
the middle muscular, and the outer fibrous.</p>

<p class='c007'>In arteries of medium size the intima consists of the endothelial
layer, a layer of delicate white and elastic fibers, connective-tissue
cells, and the membrana elastica interna, or an outer layer, the
elastic layer, of the intima.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>media</i> consists of a thick coat of circularly arranged smooth
muscle cells, its thickness depending largely upon the size of the
vessels. There is also a small amount of fibrillary connective tissue,
which supports the muscle cells. Elastic tissue is present in the
media, the amount depending on the size of the vessel, the larger
the vessel the more elastic tissue there is present. In the large
arteries coarse elastic fibers intermingle with the finer ones. When
much elastic tissue is present the muscle cells are separated into
more or less well-defined groups.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>The <i>adventitia</i> is composed of loose connective tissue with some
elastic fibers. A few smooth muscle cells are present, which, as are
also the elastic fibers, are arranged longitudinally. The adventitia,
blending with the connective tissue surrounding the arteries, serves
to anchor the vessels to the surrounding structure.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Structure of the Veins.</b>—In many respects the walls of the veins
resemble those of the arteries. The same three coats exist and the
same elements enter into their structure. The transition from capillary
to small veins, and from those to larger veins, is similar to the
transition from the arteries to capillaries, in inverse order. The
walls are not so thick as those of arteries. The elastic tissue is
much less in quantity and in smaller veins disappears. There is
not a clear line of demarcation between the intima and the media.</p>

<p class='c007'>The veins of birds differ from those of mammals in that they have
fewer <i>valves</i>. The valves are also less perfect, and often permit a
backward flow of blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The walls of the arteries and of the veins are supplied with nutrient
blood-vessels. These are called the <i>vasa vasorum</i>, or blood-vessels
of the blood-vessel wall. They are mostly in the adventitia.
They may arise from the vessel to which they are distributed or take
origin from an adjacent vessel. These small arteries supplying the
vessel coat after terminating into capillaries form small veins through
which the blood, from the structure of the vessel wall, is returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The walls of the blood-vessels are supplied with both medullated
and non-medullated nerves. The non-medullated nerve fibers are
axones of the sympathetic neurones and control the caliber of the
vessels. These fibers are called the <i>vasomotor nerves</i>. They form
plexuses in the adventitia, from which are given off branches which
penetrate the media and terminate on the muscle cells. The medullated
nerves are the axones of the spinal nerves. The larger fibers
are found in the connective tissue outside the adventitia and give
off branches to the media where they divide repeatedly, lose their
sheath, and terminate in the media and at times in the intima.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Arterial Trunks</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The <i>common aorta</i> is short; it originates from the left ventricle
(Fig. 61<i>B</i>, No. <i>K</i>, 14), and is guarded by three <i>semi-lunar valves</i>. The
aorta breaks through the pericardium just to the right of the pulmonary
arteries in a ventral direction; it then turns upward dorsally
and to the right of the inferior bodies of the vertebræ. It is then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>directed anteriorly, and dorsally to the right bronchus, between the
right bronchus and the right lung. The right and the left coronaries
are given off from the common aorta; they have been discussed.
There is next given off the left brachio-cephalic or <i>brachio-cephalic
sinister artery</i> (Fig. 61<i>B</i>, No. <i>K</i>, 10), which is just above the
border of the base of the heart. This artery passes upward and slightly
forward, over the center of the inferior larynx. Just beyond this
point the <i>subclavian artery</i> is given off; this artery later becomes the
axillary and the axillary the brachial artery. Then there is given
off the anterior and the posterior thoracic arteries; and finally, the
pectoral, which supply the pectoralis muscles and later terminate
in the carotid, the vertebral, and the cervical arteries. The carotid
artery gives off an esophageal artery. The other arterial trunk given
off from the common aorta is the right brachio-cephalic or brachio-cephalic
dexter (Fig. 61<i>B</i>, No. <i>K</i>, 18). The right brachio-cephalic
artery gives off the subclavian, which continues as the axillary,
and continues as the brachial artery. There is given off the anterior
and the posterior thoracic, the right carotid (Fig. 61<i>B</i>, No. <i>K</i>, 11), the
vertebral, and the dorsal. The last continues as the cervical.</p>

dexter and the other the pulmonalis sinister. The former goes to
the right and the latter to the left lung. Each branch penetrates
the lung near the bronchus. These arteries divide, or branch,
similarly to the bronchi. Following the branchings of the bronchi,
they finally terminate into the lung capillaries, forming networks
on the bronchi and the air-tube terminals.</p>

  <h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Carotid Trunk</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The <b>carotis communis</b> artery springs from the carotid trunk of
the brachio-cephalic. It is directed horizontally, ascending to the
ventral side of the neck. It then extends downward to the inferior
median neck region. Just after leaving its origin it gives off several
small branches to the bronchi and to the esophagus, and extends
toward the head. The carotid lies on the thyroid gland and at this
point touches the jugular vein (Fig. 21). At this point the <b>thyroid
arteries</b> are given off from the carotid trunk. The thyroid gland
also receives blood from the bronchialis artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dorsalward and near the thyroid gland the carotid artery gives
off a branch (the bronchialis) which accompanies the recurrent
laryngeal nerve, along the inferior larynx and the bronchi, and
supplies the lung substance and that part of the esophagus in this
region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vertebral artery</b> is given off from the carotid trunk, dorsalward
to the thyroid gland, and on the left side. The right vertebral
artery may be given off from the brachialis dextra or right brachialis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>inferior esophageal artery</b> is given off from the ventral side
of the carotid, supplies the esophagus, extends then to the skin of
the neck and to the trachea, is directed anteriorly toward the
head and anastomoses with the vertebral artery. This artery accompanies
the vagus nerve and forms a collateral artery to the
carotid and the vertebral artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>subcutaneous colli</b> springs from the carotid artery near
the thyroid gland and communicates with the inferior cervical artery,
which, in turn springs from the vertebral artery.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Common Carotid.</b>—Near the last cervical vertebra the two
carotid arteries occupy the same channel, to which they are attached
by fascia, and, lying close to the inferior surface of the bodies of the
cervical vertebræ, are covered by the colli muscles. Near the third
or the fourth cervical vertebra, the two carotid arteries separate.
Near the atlas each carotid divides into the <i>carotis cerebralis</i> and
<i>carotis externa</i>. Near this division the <i>superior cervical artery</i>
branches off. This latter artery extends down the neck in company
with the pneumogastric nerve and the jugular vein, supplies the
skin and the neck muscles, and anastomoses with the inferior cervical
artery and the subcutaneous colli artery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>The <i>occipital artery</i> originates either from the carotis communis
or sometimes from the superior cervical.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Carotis Cerebralis</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The branches of the carotis cerebralis are as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The <b>occipitalis</b> (Fig. 72, No. 18), which in turn gives off, first,
the occipitalis sublimis. The <i>occipitalis sublimis</i> supplies the outer
and the middle portion of the digastricus and the posterior mylo-hyoideus
muscle. It also gives off, second, the <i>occipitalis profunda</i>
which supplies the inner portion of the digastricus muscle and
becomes the <i>meningeal artery</i>, which passes through the foramen
vagi, entering the brain cavity, where it supplies the coverings of
the brain as far as the sella turcica. Superficial branches of this
artery are distributed to the muscles in the region of the atlas and
anastomose with the vertebral artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The <b>ophthalmica externa</b>, which passes below the articulation
of the quadrate bone, around the tympanic cavity, enters the
canalis caroticus, and passes into the cranial cavity. The ramus
occipitalis, passing out of the same foramen, again enters the diploë
of the cranium; then after passing dorsally over the upper outer
semicircular canal of the ear, passes backward through the occipital
bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ophthalmica externa (Fig. 72, No. 9) forms a main trunk and
gives off two branches: the <i>temporal artery</i> and the <i>recurrent
ophthalmic</i>. The recurrent ophthalmic gives off the <i>rete temporalis</i>,
<i>rete ethmoidalis</i>, a branch to the orbital gland, and finally anastomoses
with its own branches and with those of the internal ophthalmic
at the olfactory foramen and aids in forming the <i>ethmoidal artery</i>.
These arteries supply blood by giving off branches to the muscles
of the eye, sclerotic coat, iris, choroid coat, and the ciliary bodies.
It gives off another branch to Harder’s gland, and finally anastomoses
with the ethmoidalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The <b>plexus temporalis</b>, rete mirabile ophthalmicum, or wonderful
network (Fig. 72, No. 8), is formed between the second and
the third trunk of the trigeminus nerve and the rete ophthalmicum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inferior to this is the <i>alveolar plexus</i>, which plexus accompanies
the third branch of the trigeminus into the lower jaw. Two main
branches form this plexus, one coming from the carotis facialis,
which anastomoses with the alveolar artery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The <i>palpebral plexus</i> lies between the trunks of the trigeminus,
and supplies mainly the lower eyelid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>plexus muscularis</i> extends to the fifth portion of the temporal
muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>plexus lacrimalis</i> forms on the posterior orbital wall on the
ramus ethmoidalis and supplies the lacrimal gland and the upper
eyelid. It anastomoses with branches from the facial artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ramus ciliaris posticus</i> supplies the inferior rectus and the
external rectus muscle of the eyeball. It anastomoses with the
ophthalmica externa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>median meningeal artery</i> passes through the foramen occupied
by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve. Passing into the
cranial cavity, it supplies the dura mater. Before passing into this
foramen, small branches are given off, which supply the skin and the
temporal muscle; and some branches anastomose with the superior
cervical and the ethmoidal arteries.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>4. The Cerebral Artery.</b>—Each cerebral artery enters the cranial
cavity through the canalis caroticus located in the sphenoid bone,
passes forward medially from the cochlea, dorsally from the Eustachian
tube, and passes through a small canal which opens on the
inner surface of the sella turcica. Originating in this foramen, the
<i>sphenoid artery</i> divides into two branches which anastomose with
the pterygoidean and the pterygo-pharyngeal artery and which
supply the upper jaw and the throat regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>spheno-maxillaris artery</i> supplies the gums.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right and the left cerebral arteries unite at the sella turcica.
After this union they divide again immediately and pass to the
base of the brain, where they give off twigs to the optic nerve, to
the optic chiasm, and where also is given off the arteria retinæ
centralis. Passing posteriorly each cerebral artery gives off the
<i>ramus posterior</i>, and then passes to the side of the cerebellum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>basilar artery</i>, a continuation of the anterior spinal artery, is
located ventrally and mesially to the cerebellum. Laterally and
inferiorly the basilar artery gives off the inferior cerebellar artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ramus anterior</i> is given off from the cerebralis artery and
continues as the <i>internal ophthalmic artery</i>. The ramus anterior
also gives off the <i>sylvian artery</i>, which supplies the sides of the cerebrum
and the middle brain. In the fissure between the hemispheres
and the optic thalamus is located the <i>arteria cerebri profunda</i>.
This artery passes along the median surface of the cerebrum and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>its course supplies the adjacent parts. It enters into the formation
of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>internal ophthalmic artery</i> extends out of the cranial cavity,
through the optic foramen, into the orbital cavity. It passes
upward along the interorbital wall and supplies the optic nerve,
the trigeminus nerve trunk, and the eye muscles, and dorsally
anastomoses near the olfactory nerve with the rete ethmoidale and
the external ophthalmic artery, and continues as the ethmoidal
artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ethmoidal artery</i> supplies the supra-orbital gland and the
gland of Harder. It gives off twigs to the rete ophthalmicum and
other branches to the skin of the frontal region, where it anastomoses
with branches of the external facial artery. These branches in
the frontal region are rather large. Large branches are given off
to the comb.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>arteria ethmoidalis externa</i> originates in the nasal cavity from
a division of the ethmoidal artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The external ethmoidal artery passes below the lacrimal bone,
extends forward, supplies the walls of the nasal cavity, and finally
sends a branch anteriorly into the upper median portion of the jaw
bone, and other branches to the septum nasi and other parts of the
nasal cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are frequent anastomoses between the ethmoidalis interna,
the facialis, and the spheno-maxillary artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>internal ethmoidal</i> artery supplies principally the posterior
turbinated bones and septum nasi.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the External Carotid Artery</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Branches from the external carotid and the facial artery supply
the tongue and its muscles, the larynx, the lower jaw bone, the
gums, and the upper lateral facial region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The external carotid (Fig. 62, No. <i>A</i>, 8) gives off the following
branches:</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the <b>hyoid artery</b> (Fig. 72, No. 12) which supplies the inner
portion of the depressor mandibular and also the cornua of the
os hyoideum, and extends to the tip of the tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, the <b>superior laryngeal artery</b> (Fig. 72, No. 16) which
supplies the sterno-brachialis and gives off branches which extend
downward to the trachea and to the esophagus. The main artery
passes along the left side of the esophagus and anastomoses with
branches of the inferior esophageal, forming collateral circulation
in that region.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Third, the <b>lingualis artery</b> (Fig. 62, No. <i>A</i>, 9) which lies between the
mylo-hyoideus and the posterior part of the hyoid bone. It supplies
the tongue muscles. It passes to the median surface of the
lower jaw bone, where are given off small branches which enter
the jaw and anastomose with the inferior alveolar artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth, the <b>Facial Artery</b>.—The facial artery divides into the
following branches:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>auricular artery</i> is given off near the articulation of the os
quadratum with the os zygomaticum. It is located at the outer
auditory canal, and its branches are distributed to the parotid
region and to the depressor mandibular, or digastricus, muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>external facial artery</i> is located between the os quadratum and
the masseter muscle. It gives off a branch to the lower jaw bone
and to the skin of that region, and then passes to the lacrimal bone
and supplies branches to the commissure of the mouth, the auditory
canal, the masseter muscle, the three eyelids (upper and lower eyelids
and the membrana nictitans), the nose cavity, and the skin in
the frontal region. It communicates on the other side with the
ethmoidal artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>internal facial artery</i> passes over and through the os pterygoideum,
supplies all the jaw muscles, and is continued as the inferior
alveolar artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>inferior alveolar artery</i> enters the canal of the lower jaw bone
along with the mandibular nerve. It is finally continued as the
mental artery, leaving the canal, and passing to the outer jaw surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facialis continues as the <i>internal maxillary artery</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The internal maxillary artery (Fig. 72, No. 15) supplies the pterygoid
muscle, the upper part of the pharynx, the commissure of the
mouth, the salivary gland region, the gums, and finally anastomoses
with branches of the spheno-maxillaris artery.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Vertebral Artery</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The vertebral artery is given off, dorsally near the thyroid gland,
from the carotis communis or from the carotid trunk. The vertebral
artery passes horizontally and dorsally into the canals formed
in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebræ. After it
leaves the carotid, it is divided into anterior and posterior branches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The <b>posterior vertebral artery</b> passes in the canals of the transverse
processes of the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra. It sends
branches into the vertebræ, into the spinal canal, and into the
intercostal muscles between the ribs and anastomoses with the
intercostal arteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>anterior vertebral artery</b> is larger than the posterior. It
extends laterally along the side of the neck in the foramen of the
transverse processes of the cervical vertebræ, and lies along the
course of the inferior vertebral vein and the deep imbedded trunk
of the sympathetic nerve. It continues to the head. In its passage
it gives off to each vertebral segment a dorsal and a ventral branch.
Twigs from these branches pass into the bodies of the vertebræ and
the spinal canal, giving nutriment to the bony structure and to the
spinal cord and its coverings. Other twigs are distributed to the
muscles of the neck and some finally anastomose with branches of
the carotis communis. This artery, reaching the head, gives off a
long anastomosing branch which passes between the atlas and
posterior part of the occipital bone and joins the ramus profundus
and the occipital artery, thus again communicating with the carotid
artery. The remainder of the vertebral artery is small and passes
through the foramen magnum into the cranial cavity where it
anastomoses with terminal branches of the cerebral artery. At the
base of the neck and before the vertebral artery enters the canal of
the cervical vertebræ, it gives off the <i>arteria cervicalis ascendens</i>,
superior artery of the crop (Fig. 73, No. 18) which branches out on
the upper surface of the crop is also distributed to the neck muscles,
and later subdivides into the transverse cervical arteries which
supply the skin and the muscles of the base of the neck, and the
shoulder region.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the ventral side of the neck there are given off two subvertebral
carotid arterial branches. They lie in a shallow furrow on the
ventral side of the cervical vertebræ and close to the median line.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Subclavian Artery</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The subclavian artery (Fig. 20, No. 13; Fig. 73, No. 11) gives off
the following branches:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <b>Sterno-clavicularis</b> (Fig. 73, No. 9) which originates on the
upper part of the subclavia, between the carotid artery and external
thoracic (Fig. 73, No. 3), divides into many branches. The sterno-clavicularis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>gives off the <i>sternal artery</i>, which enters by the side of the
supra-coracoid muscle and the anterior rim of the sternum. It is
distributed to the inner surface and over the air-sac. Another
outside branch passes the posterior end of the crista sterna and
supplies the large breast muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>clavicular artery</i> (Fig. 73, No. 8) accompanies the clavicle to
the shoulder-joint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>acromial artery</i> is given off from the sterno-clavicularis on
the ligament near the shoulder-joint.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The <b>thoracic artery</b> branches from the subclavian artery (Fig.
70, No. 4). The thoracic artery gives off the following branches:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>internal mammary</i>, or <i>internal thoracic artery</i> (Fig. 73, No. 16)
arises on the inner side of the sternum and extends downward and
backward, giving nutrient branches to the anterior vena cava and
to the diaphragm. At the point of the costo-sternal muscle it
divides into an inner and an outer branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inner branch supplies the costo-sternal muscle and extends
along the ribs and along their juncture with the breast-bone. It
finally extends posteriorly, giving numerous branches to the abdominal
muscles. The outer branch is distributed in a similar manner,
giving off branches to the diaphragm and to the abdominal muscles,
and anastomoses, on the surface of the abdominal muscles, with the
epigastric artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>external thoracic artery</i> (Fig. 73, No. 3), ramus superior,
supplies principally the large breast muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>inferior thoracic artery</i>, external ramus inferior, passes along
the outside of the pectoralis major muscle, extends downward,
and gives off the arteria thoracica longa (subcutaneous thoracic).
This latter artery supplies the skin of the breast region. Other
branches are given off to the muscles of the breast and to the skin
of the region, and some finally anastomose with the branches of the
sternal artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The <b>axillary artery</b> (Fig. 73, No. 12) extends out of the thoracic
cavity along with the brachial nerve plexus. It gives off the <i>subscapularis</i>
which supplies the muscles of the scapular region. The
axillary artery terminates as the <i>brachialis</i> which passes between
the biceps brachii and anconeus muscles downward along the
humeral shaft. It gives off the anterior humeral circumflex artery
and the brachialis profunda artery (Fig. 68, No. 3). It gives off
near the elbow-joint the ulnar and radial arteries.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The <i>anterior circumflex humeral artery</i> passes through the short
head of the biceps and gives off a branch to the biceps muscle,
supplying the insertional part of the breast muscles.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Brachialis Profunda</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The brachialis profunda artery (Fig. 68, No. 3) continues as the
<i>posterior circumflex humeral artery</i>. This artery supplies the muscles
of the posterior part of the humerus, the skin of the wing, and
the muscles of the brachial region. The trunk of the arteria brachii
profunda passes downward along the anconeus muscle, supplying
that muscle and giving off the collateral ulnar artery. On the ulnar
olecranon it anastomoses with the recurrent ulnar, thus establishing,
at this region, collateral circulation. The rest of the brachialis
sends branches to the biceps muscle and to the skin of the upper
arm, and finally gives off the arteria collateralis radialis, which
supplies the condylo-ulnaris. It then anastomoses with the end
branches of the recurrent radialis artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>radial artery</i> (Fig. 67, No. 4) passes downward on the outer
rim of the forearm. It continues down to the carpal region, where
it supplies the muscles and the skin of the carpal region it gives off
the recurrent radial, which passes on the middle finger and finally
anastomoses with the collateral radialis artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ulnar artery</i> (Fig. 68, No. 6 and 9) passes downward on the
inner surface of the ulna to the carpal region where it gives off a
branch to the wing plexus and divides into two branches, the smaller
branch supplying the thumb (Fig. 68, No. 7). This branch passes
down the radial side of the middle finger to the last joint of the
second finger. The larger (Fig. 68, No. 8) lies between the second
and the third finger bones, and passes through a slit between these
two bones to the flexor side of the hand and extends to the last
finger-joint, supplying the structures in the region. The ulnar
artery gives off a small arterial twig to the papilla of each large wing
feather (Fig. 67, No. 6).</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>recurrent ulnar</i> passes backward to the olecranon of the ulna
and supplies the muscles, the skin, the feathers, and other structures
of the region, and terminates in end collateral ulnar branches
(Fig. 67, No. 5).</p>

<p class='c007'>The posterior aorta (Fig. 63, No. 2) passes backward along the
inferior part of the bodies of the dorsal and lumbo-sacral vertebræ.
In the thoracic cavity it lies dorsal to the esophagus. It gives
branches (<i>esophageal</i>) only to the esophagus during its passage as far
as the seventh dorsal vertebra. Following this point there are given
of several pairs of arteries which divide into a superior and an inferior
branch. The superior branch extends upward and anastomoses
with branches of the vertebral artery and other twigs coming from
the <i>intercostal arteries</i>. These latter arteries given off are small
dorsal arteries. The inferior branches extend downward between
the ribs and supply the intercostal muscles. The intercostal arteries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>do not take their origin from the aorta in numerous and regular
branches as in mammals; they consist originally of but few vessels,
which are multiplied by anastomoses with each other and with
the arteries which come out of the spinal canal. An arterial plexus
is thus formed around the head of each rib, from which a vessel
is sent to each of the intercostal muscles and ribs and are continued
into the muscles upon the outside of the body and its integuments.
The anastomosis of the intercostal arteries round the ribs is similar
to the plexus, which is produced by the great sympathetic nerve in
the same location. The <i>lumbar arteries</i> are given off farther posteriorly
and along the lumbar region. The lumbar, like the dorsal
branches are given off in pairs. These arterial branches pass along
the thigh and the upper sacral vertebral region, and supply those
parts. Ventrally they are covered by the kidneys and pass into
the abdominal muscles. The posterior aorta gives off the <i>spermatic
arteries</i> and the <i>ovarian artery</i>. In the male the former supply
the testes. The ovarian artery of the female gives off a twig to each
calyx containing an ovum. Each calyx is voluminously supplied
with blood. Next the <i>renal arteries</i> are given off to the kidneys.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>celiac axis</b> (Fig. 64, No. 17) originates near the seventh sternal
vertebra and to the right of the esophagus, breaks through the
diaphragm, and, near this point, gives off a recurrent esophageal
(Fig. 64, No. 23). The celiac axis gives off three main branches:
The anterior or recurrent dexter, the posterior or recurrent sinister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the recurrent intestinalis, all of which lie to the right of the spleen,
under the left lobe of the liver, and along the left side of the stomach.
The <i>recurrent sinister</i> (Fig. 64, No. 20) gives arterial branches to
the proventriculus, the gizzard, the pyloris, and the left lobe of the
liver. The anterior or recurrent dexter (Fig. 64, No. 21) gives off a
renal artery and from four to six splenic arteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>recurrent intestinalis artery</i> (Fig. 64, No. 24) arises on the
posterior of the stomach within the duodenal loop, and supplies
the duodenum and the pancreas (Fig. 63, No. 7). It gives off a
branch, called the recurrent ilio-colicus (Fig. 64, No. 25), which
supplies the large intestines, including the cæca.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>arteria hepatica dextra</i> (Fig. 64, No. 22) is a branch from the
celiac axial trunk. It gives several branches to the right lobe of
the liver and to the gall-bladder. The gastric branches pass to
the muscles of the stomach. The anterior and posterior recurrent
branches often anastomose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>anterior mesenteric artery</b> (Fig. 63, No. 5; Fig. 64, No. 26)
originates from the posterior aorta near the generative glands. It
is directed downward, and divides into many branches which pass
in the mesentery toward the intestines. Recurrent branches (Fig.
64, No. 27) are given off, which anastomose, forming mesenteric
arches. From these arches are given off branches which supply the
intestinal walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior mesenteric artery gives off the <i>recurrent ilio-celiacus</i>
(Fig. 64, No. 28) which is distributed to the cæca; other of its
branches are distributed to the small intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior mesenteric artery extends along the small intestine
and ends in the <i>recurrent superior hemorrhoidal arteries</i> (Fig. 64, No.
29) which anastomoses on the surface of the rectum with a branch
of the posterior mesenteric artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Branches from the anterior mesenteric artery also anastomose
with branches of the celiac axis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>posterior mesenteric artery</b> (Fig. 64, No. 30) is given off from
the posterior aorta posterior to the origin of the anterior mesenteric
and near the arteries of the thigh and is distributed to the lesser
mesentery supplying the large intestine. Branches of the superior
hemorrhoidal arteries anastomose with branches of the posterior
mesenteric artery. Branches from this source are called the <i>median
hemorrhoidal</i> (Fig. 63, No. 6).</p>

<p class='c007'>The posterior mesenteric artery (Fig. 64, No. 30) also gives off a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>long branch to the cæca. Branches of the posterior mesenteric
artery anastomose with branches of the anterior mesenteric.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>crural arteries</b> (Fig. 64, No. 31) are given off in a pair from
the posterior aorta. They pass through the mass of the lobes of the
kidneys, at about the median region, and extend out of the pelvic
cavity in front of the spine and ilio-pubic ligament.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the <i>internal pelvic</i>, or <i>umbilical artery</i>, is given off just as
the cruralis leaves the pelvic cavity. It passes, as a long vessel,
on the inner surface of the lumbo-sacral bones and supplies the
obturator internus muscle and extends into the umbilical region.
It gives off branches to the abdominal muscles, and, in the female, a
branch is distributed to the ligament of the oviduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, the <i>arteria circumflex femoris</i>, which passes between the
sartorius and vastus internus and extends dorsalward, supplies
the sartorius muscle, the vasti muscles, and the ilio-trochanteric
region.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third, the <i>femoral artery</i>, which passes beside the vena cruralis
and extends down the posterior surface of the thigh to the knee-joint,

is given off from the posterior aorta and passes ventrally over and
between two of the main lobes of the kidney. The continuation
of the posterior aorta is called the <i>sacralis media</i> (Fig. 64,
No. 32). The ischiadic artery gives off a <i>recurrent renalis</i> on the
posterior lobe of the kidney (Fig. 64, No. 33). On the left side it
gives off a branch to the oviduct and to the ligament of the oviduct.
The main trunk leaves the cavity with the ischiadic nerve (Fig. 65,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>No. 1) through a foramen formed by the os ilium and the os ischium.
It sends branches into the adductor muscles of the upper and the
lower thigh. It gives off anastomotic branches which unite with
those from the femoral artery. At the flexure of the knee-joint it
gives off two branches to that region (Fig. 69, No. 10). It gives off
another branch to the gastrocnemius muscle and one to the flexor
perforans digitorum. It terminates in the anterior and posterior
tibial arteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first, the <i>tibialis postica</i> (Fig. 69, No. 12) passes
between the gastrocnemius and the deep flexors giving off branches
in its course to the skin and to other parts, and disappears shortly
below the intertarsal joint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second, the <i>tibialis antica</i> (Fig. 66, No. 1; Fig. 69, No. 11),
is often the larger of the two arteries. The anterior tibial artery
gives off branches to the knee-joint and to adjacent structures. It
gives a large branch to the head of the gastrocnemius muscle. It
passes to the posterior surface of the tibial head and gives off the
peroneal artery, which passes through the membrana interossea
located between the tibia and fibula giving branches to the anterior
side of the membrane of the patellar region of the knee-joint. It
gives branches to the anterior side of the lower thigh and finally
terminates subcutaneously in the anterior tibial plexus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main portion of the anterior tibial artery passes downward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>along the posterior surface of the membrane located between the
tibia and fibula, and sends branches for the flexor digitorum communis
et profundus. It then breaks through the membrane,
reaches the anterior side and there communicates with the anterior
tibial plexus. It gives off branches to the muscles on the anterior
side of the lower thigh and the skin, and passes between the outer
and the middle malleolus of the tarsal bones. It passes to the
plantar surface and divides between the toes. In addition to the
plantar branches there are given off dorsal branches between the
third and the fourth toes. These branches form the direct continuation
of the dorsal vessels of the anterior tibial plexus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vena cephalica posterior (Fig. 62, No. <i>B</i>, 8) is formed from
the veins of the sinuses of the cranium, the brain, the vena auris,
the vena jugularis prima, the vena carotis, and the vena occipitalis.
It collects most of the blood from the cranium and the posterior part
of the head and from the tongue.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE VENOUS SINUSES OF THE HEAD</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <b>sinus longitudinalis</b> (Fig. 62, <i>A</i>, 10) extends from the dorsal
median line of the internal occipital protuberance to the olfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>nerve. It collects the blood from the choroidea of the brain and
from the skin of the frontal region. It receives laterally the veins
of the nose, the vena ophthalmica, and the sinus transversus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus occipitalis</b> (Fig. 62, No. <i>A</i>, 4) forms the continuation
of the transverse sinus. It is located in the posterior cerebral
cavity, and is wing-shaped, extending both to the right and to the
left.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus foraminis occipitalis</b> a continuation of the sinus occipitalis,
lies transversely on the ventral side of the cranial cavity
and receives the veins from the medulla oblongata. One branch
passes through the os occipitalis basilare, and then extends sidewise
to the foramen magnum and anastomoses with the vena
occipitalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus transversus</b> (Fig. 62, No. <i>A</i>, 6) extends in a pair from
the internal occipital protuberance between the cerebrum, cerebellum,
and the corpus quadrigeminum. It receives vessels from
the upper surface of the cerebellum. The sinus has three branches,
all of which empty into the sinus semicircularis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus semicircularis</b> extends along the dorsal petrosal rim,
anterior to the inner ear, and from this point backward. Near the
foramen magnum it passes through the os occipitale and empties
into the external occipital vein.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena occipitalis externus</b> extends near the foramen magnum,
surrounds the basis occipitalis, and receives the semicircular sinus
and through the semicircular sinus the blood from the sinus transversus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus petrosus sphenoideus</b>, passing in company with the
occipital sinus, extends from the transverse sinus to the cavity near
which the trigeminus lies. The sinus dividing into two branches,
one of these extends to the hypophysis and unites with the basal
veins of the brain; the other passes with the rete out of the cranial
cavity along with a branch of the trigeminus, and communicates
with the rete mirabile temporale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus temporo-sphenoideus</b> (Fig. 62, No. <i>A</i>, 5) extends forward
and outward from the transverse sinus, and, between the
corpus quadrigeminum and the cerebrum, unites with the sinus
venosus annularis basilaris.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus venosus annularis basilaris</b> lies in the region of the
optic nerve and surrounds the hypophysis, forming a complete circle.
It receives small vessels from the cerebrum, the corpora quadrigemina,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>and anteriorly the longitudinal basilar vein or vena basilaris
media, of the cerebrum, which comes out of the anterior annular
venous sinus. The anterior annular venous sinus surrounds the base
of the olfactory nerves. It communicates with the sinus petrosus
sphenoideus, which emerges from behind the optic lobe, the sinus
temporo-sphenoideus, which emerges from in front of the optic lobe,
and posteriorly the median longitudinal vein of the medulla oblongata
or vena basilaris. Laterally and anterior to the optic lobe
it receives the vena basilaris lateralis, and also a branch of the
vena ophthalmica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blood received by the <b>sinus annularis basilaris</b> comes from
the brain cavity through three pairs of veins, as follows: first, the
two ophthalmic veins which pass through the posterior orbital wall
between the olfactory and the optic nerve; second, two other branches
of the ophthalmica which pass with the optic nerve; third, two
veins which pass through a foramen by the side of the sella turcica
to the hypophysis together with the carotis cerebralis, and then
leave the cerebral cavity ventrally, at which point they are called
the venæ carotes. These last accompany the cerebral artery backward,
and pass through a foramen in the base of the cranium.
Each one then passes through the cranial wall close to the external
auditory canal, and empties into another vein in the posterior region
of the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sinus fovæ hemispherii cerebelli</b> lies in the hollow between
the os petrosum and the semicircular canals. It receives blood from
the external occipital sinus and from the cerebellum, and empties
into the vena auris interna.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VEINS OF THE BRAIN CAVITY</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <b>vena auris interna</b> passes through a bony canal along the
outer rim of the posterior semicircular canal and then along the
external semicircular canal. It receives vessels from the labyrinth,
and extends along the posterior rim of the tympanum to the outer
ear canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena occipitalis interna</b>, extending from the sinus foraminis
occipitalis, passes through the side of the atlas and divides near the
condyle into two branches. One of these branches the internal
occipital, forms the root of the vena vertebralis, and the other
empties into the vena occipitalis externa.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Near the outer and upper part of the condyle it forms two large
veins and collects the blood from the vena occipitalis media. These
veins collect the blood from the rectus capitis anticus, and communicate
with the vena cephalica anterior.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena occipitalis externa</b>, sometimes called the vena occipitalis
collateralis, extends from the vena auris, and receives vessels
from the neck region. It receives on the side of the occipitoatloid
joint the vena occipitalis interna. The vena occipitalis
externa forms a junction with the vena vertebralis emptying
into the transverse vein.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE VEINS OF THE NECK</h3>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Vena Jugularis</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The trunks of the vena jugularis or vena cephalica communis
pass subcutaneously on both sides near the trachea and the esophagus.
Near the height of the thyroid gland they almost touch the
carotid artery. They then cross, dorsalward, the trunk of the subclavian
artery, and in their course receive the vertebral vein and
unite with the subclavian vein toward the side of the vena brachiocephalica.
The union on the right side lies to the right of the
anterior aorta, and the union on the left side lies to the left of the
pulmonary artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jugular vein (Fig. 18, No. 4) receives in its course the following
veins:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ linguales</b> (Fig. 62, No. <i>B</i>, 7), which at times empty
into the vena cephalica posterior.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena occipito-collares</b>, which arises on the ventral side from
the muscles of the neck and the vertebræ; empties into the vena
occipitalis lateralis and also communicates with the vena jugularis
by anastomoses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ ascendentes laterales</b>, which collect blood from the
lateral sides of the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ colli cutineæ</b>, which enter the jugular vein laterally.
The upper branches are directed crosswise, and are shorter than the
lower ones. The lower branches are located near the thorax, are
directed upward, and anastomose by fine terminal twigs. Plexuses
are frequently formed in the inner side of the skin of the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ glandularum thyroidearum</b> are several small, short
veins coming from the thyroid gland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena vertebralis</b>, originating near the atlas, is a continuation
of the internal occipital vein. The internal occipital vein receives
the bulk of the blood from the brain and communicates with the
lateral veins of the cervical region and collects blood from the cervical
vertebra. The vertebral vein accompanies the vertebral
artery and the deep sympathetic nerve trunk in the vertebral canal.
The vein either leaves this canal with the vertebral artery at a point
near the last two vertebral nerve trunks of the brachial plexus, or
it leaves the canal one vertebra in front of the vertebral artery.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE VEINS OF THE DORSAL REGION</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <b>vena vertebralis lateralis dorsalis</b> collects blood from the
cervical vertebræ, from the dorsal vertebræ, and from the intercostal
region.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The blood from the neural canal, including the spinal cord, is
collected in one long vein extending from the head to the tail on
the upper side of the cord. This vein has sinus-like expansions.
Between each two vertebræ it anastomoses with the vertebral vein
on each side. In the lumbo-sacral region these anastomotic branches
empty into the hypogastric veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena intercostalis</b> is formed in the costal region and anastomoses
with the vein extending longitudinally between the
capitulum and the tuberculum of the rib.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena vertebralis posterior</b> at the height of the first and the
second dorsal vertebræ, empties into the main trunk of the vertebral
vein. Its lower roots come out near the side of the kidney,
and unite, forming a large ascending trunk uniting with the vena
vertebralis anterior forming one large trunk, which extends into the
chest cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The posterior vertebral vein also receives a large vein from the skin
of the outer tarsal region and a few vessels from the muscles of
the outer abdominal and the outer costal region, from the skin,
from the pectoralis muscles, and from the shoulder region.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VEINS OF THE THORAX</h3>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Branches of the Vena Subclavia</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The <b>vena thoracica externa</b> (Fig. 73, No. 2) is made up of veins
mainly from the pectoral group of muscles. The posterior branch
anastomoses with the vena cutinea. Its anterior branch is made up
mainly of branches from the furcular region. It empties into the
vena pectoralis externa and the vena pectoralis externa empties into
the vena subclavia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena coracoidea</b> comes out of the region of the shoulder-joint,
passes downward along the inner surface of the coracoid,
and receives small branches from the walls of the arteria brachia
cephalica and from the pericardium.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena sternalis</b> (Fig. 73, No. 1) is made up of two branches.
The outer branch comes from the muscles of the subclavian region
passes over the cristi sterni, medially, to the sterno-coracoid joint
and into the breast cavity, where it receives the inner branch,
which drains the inner surface of the breast-bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena thoracica interna</b> empties into the vena cava anterior.
It extends from the abdominal muscles where it communicates with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the epigastric vein. It then passes on the inner side of the thoracic
cavity close to the breast-bone and receives many intercostal veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena cava sinistra</b> receives first, the <i>vena proventricularis
communis</i>, which collects the blood from the walls of the proventriculus,
and second, the vena coronaria cardis magna. This latter
vein originates close to the apex of the heart and collects blood
principally from the walls of the left ventricle. It connects in
the left sulcus transversus with the vena cardis superior and ends
at the base of the left upper vena cava. Its exit is not guarded
by a valve. The veins of the right ventricle are partly on the
surface. They collect blood along the sulcus transversus dexter
and enter directly into the right ventricle. The veins of the front
part of the heart are small. They collect behind the sulcus coronalis
and end either directly into the right auricle or into the vena
cardis magna.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VEINS OF THE FORE LIMB</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <b>vena radialis profunda</b> accompanies the radial artery on the
dorsal anterior rim of the index-finger and passes, on the dorsal
side, over the carpal region. It passes through the interosseous
ligament between the ulna and the radius, and reaches the ventral
surface of the arm. At this point it passes upward and anastomoses
with the vena ulnaris. It collects the blood from the skin of the
anterior wing region and the flexor muscles of the anterior arm. It
empties into the vena brachialis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena humeri profunda</b> (Fig. 68, No. 1) emerges at the height
of the elbow, and collects blood from the skin of the dorsal surface
of the wing. It also receives veins from the muscles of the posterior
side of the upper arm. It passes subcutaneously and dorsally over
the dorsal portion of the humerus in company with the external
radial muscle and passes with it around the external part of the humerus
between the long and short heads of the triceps. It takes a
diagonal course to the shoulder cavity and at that point empties into
the brachial trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>profundus ulnaris</b> originates at the volar surface of the hand,
proceeds in company with the ulnar artery, and sends on the base of
the hand small anastomotic veins to the vena cutanea ulnaris or
basilica. It passes along the anterior arm and between the flexor
carpi ulnaris and the pronator profundus muscle to the elbow-joint.
On the median surface of the biceps it passes upward and anastomoses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>with the radial vein. The ulnar vein, in the region of the elbow-joint,
receives a large lateral branch which extends around the end
tendon of the biceps and anastomoses above with the vena basilica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena basilica</b> or cutanea ulnaris is a long vein which originates
from the subcutaneous dorsal surface of the index-finger. Near the
base of the hand it receives an anastomosing branch from the vena
radialis and the vena ulnaris, and then passes upward along the
posterior rim of the ulna. It receives numerous branches from the
roots of the flight feathers. It crosses below the elbow-joint and
reaches the volar surface of the arm. It receives a large branch
from the ulnar vein, and then, passing in a diagonal and median
direction to the triceps, extends to the shoulder cavity where it
empties into the axillary vein.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outer breast veins unite forming a trunk which crosses ventrally
to the subclavian artery, and empties into the subclavian
vein.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vena cutanea abdomino-pectoralis collects the blood from a
large skin area of the abdomen, the upper thigh, the breast, and the
intercostal region. In the skin of the abdomen it forms a network.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE POSTERIOR VENA CAVA</h3>

<p class='c015'>The posterior vena cava (Fig. 63, No. 18; Fig. 70, No. 8) has its
origin in the posterior half of the body of the bird, somewhat to
the right of the posterior aorta, near the anterior lobe of the kidney,
by the union of the right and the left vena iliaca communis. It
receives the blood from all of the posterior half of the body including
the posterior limbs, of the visceral organs, of the abdominal and the
pelvic cavity. The posterior vena cava passes dorsally through
the right lobe of the liver and through the diaphragm and ends in a
short, broad trunk on the posterior dorsal side of the right auricle
of the heart. Its opening into the heart is guarded by two half-moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>shaped valves. The basal part of the trunk reaches from the
right auricle of the heart to the upper anterior rim of the liver where
it receives three large trunks, first, the right and second, the left
vena portalis hepatica magna, and third, smaller vessels from the
liver substance.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE VEINS OF THE POSTERIOR EXTREMITY</h3>

<p class='c015'>In the skin region on the inner sides of the toes near their bases
the small veins collect into five metatarsal veins. The largest vein

passes up the tarsus and is called the vena metatarsalis interna, or
vena magna (Fig. 65, No. 7). It is located just beneath the skin
on the inner surface of the metatarsal bone. It passes in a circle,
around the condyle of the tibia and becomes the <b>vena tibialis postica</b>
(Fig. 65, No. 3 and 8). The vena tibialis postica passes under the
tendon Achillis and the tendon of the flexor digitorum brevis, lies
subcutaneously upon the latter, and reaching the knee-joint crosses
over the upper surface of the ischiadic nerve and becomes the
<b>vena poplitealis</b>, at which point it receives the vena tibialis antica.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>On the dorsal side of the metatarsus are two veins. The <b>vena
metatarsalis dorsalis profunda</b> (Fig. 65, No. 11), which extends under
the tendon of the extensors of the toes, along with the artery and the
nerve. It collects the blood from the third and the fourth toe and in
the middle of the metatarsus receives the <b>vena metatarsalis
dorsalis interna</b> (Fig. 65, No. 4), which connects the vena metatarsalis
dorsalis profunda and the vena magna. The two dorsal veins
anastomose with the vena magna, at the intertarsal joint. They
pass transversely under the ligament and form the main trunk of the
vena tibialis antica which lies close to the anterior surface of the
tibia. Near this point there is formed a plexus of veins which
again form a trunk and communicates with the vena peronealis and
enters between the tibia and fibula with the tibialis antica. It
extends along the flexure of the knee and the posterior part of the
lower thigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena metatarsalis externa</b> passes subcutaneously on the
outside of the fourth toe and the metatarsus, and above the
intertarsal point joins the tibialis postica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena metatarsalis plantaris profunda</b> (Fig. 65, No. 5) lies
on the ventral side of the foot and forms several anastomosing
arches with the other veins of the toes. Below the intertarsal joint
it enters the vena metatarsalis magna (Fig. 65, No. 9).</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena cutanea cruralis</b> (Fig. 69, No. 7) originates at the height
of the tarsal region and passes subcutaneously on the outer posterior
surface of the lower thigh region to the vena poplitealis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ surales</b> or inferior muscular branches of the vena poplitealis
consist of many veins. One branch comes from the region of the
shank and from the gastrocnemius muscle; another as a main branch
from the posterior surface of the lower thigh; and a third from the
outer surface of the muscles and skin of the upper thigh. The three
branches together with the anterior and posterior tibial (Fig. 69,
No. 2) unite at the flexure of the knee forming the vena poplitealis
(Fig. 69, No. 1).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the region of the upper thigh, between the knee and the abdominal
cavity, the following four veins form the vena cruralis:
(Fig. 66, No. 6; Fig. 69, No. 5). First, the <b>vena cutanea abdominalis
femoralis</b> (Fig. 69, No. 6) which comes out of the side of the abdominal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>wall, draining the skin of the inner surface of the upper portion
of the thigh, the adductor muscles, and the region of the abdominal
and the breast border. It crosses the ischiadic artery in a diagonal
direction, and enters the vena cruralis in the middle of the crural
region.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, the <b>vena femoralis interna profunda</b> (Fig. 69, No. 3) forms
a communication between the end of the suralis near the knee. It
lies on the median portion of the flexor cruris internus muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third, the <b>vena femoralis anterior</b> (Fig. 69, No. 4) is formed
from branches from the sartorius and adjacent structures, and
anteriorly empties into the crural vein near where the latter enters
the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth, the <b>vena epigastrica</b> (Fig. 70, No. 33) is formed by branches
from the abdominal wall and branches from the walls of the abdominal
air-sacs. It passes along the median surface of the os pubis
and ends into the vena cruralis near the spine of the ilio-pubica or at
a point where these join with the vena hypogastrica.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VEINS OF THE CAUDAL REGION AND OF THE PELVIC CAVITY</h3>

<p class='c015'>The vena iliaca interna or the vena hypogastrica (Fig. 70, No. 22)
collects most of the blood from the tail. The vena iliaca interna
collects most of the blood from the pelvic cavity, and the adjacent
intestines. It unites with the vena iliaca externa (Fig. 70, No. 27)
and receives the vena renalis magna and forms the trunk of the
vena iliaca communis (Fig. 70, No. 26).</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena coccygea</b> originates between the coccygeal vertebræ,
and collects the blood from the region of the tail, including the tail
feathers, the tail muscles, the tail gland, and the skin of the region.
These small collecting vessels form a trunk on each side of the coccyx.
The right and the left pass laterally, each one taking up a vena
cutanea et pudenda, and frequently anastomosing with the vessels
on the other side. These often unite into one vessel. Both trunks
are connected by a transverse, or anastomotic, vessel. At this
anastomosis there empty into it the vena coccygea mesenterica and
the vena portalis. There also communicate at this point the right
and the left hypogastrica caudalis. In its course it is partly imbedded
in the kidney and passes anteriorly to the vena iliaca communis.
This circle is called the arcus hypogastricus. Thus the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>veins of the abdominal cavity have many anastomoses forming
many arcs, making possible two outlets for the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The azygos sacralis empties into the arcus at about its middle.
From here it extends forward to the inside and under the kidney and
empties into the vena suprarenalis externa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena cutanea pubica</b> originates on the lower portion of the
abdomen, collects the blood from the muscles of the distal part of
the ischium, and enters the pelvic cavity between the ischium and
the ilium. It joins with the vena cutanea caudalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena cutanea caudalis</b> originates from branches which drain
the skin and other parts of the ventral coccygeal region. The vena
cutanea pubica also communicates with the vena caudalis muscularis
and with the vena pudenda, thus forming the caudal trunk of the
vena hypogastrica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena pudenda</b> originates in the walls of the cloaca in the
region of the generative organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A small <b>vena spermatica</b> accompanies the lower end of the vas
deferens and the ureter, and empties medially into the vena pudenda.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pars renalis of the vena hypogastrica extends from the middle
of the arcus to the union of the vena hypogastrica and the vena
cruralis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena hypogastrica</b> communicates with the pars renalis.
The vessels that empty into the pars renalis are as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ sacrales</b> collect blood from the dorsal wall of the
abdominal cavity and enter the pelvis through the foramen sacralis.
They pass between the pelvic wall and kidney, and at times pass
through the kidney tissue. They empty into the pars renalis of the
hypogastric arch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ intervertebrales sacrales</b> (Fig. 72, No. 2) originate
in the region of the roots of the plexus of sacral nerves and pass
through the kidney substance or on the dorsal surface and empty into
the pars renalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ renales</b> (Fig. 72, No. 1) are very numerous and originate
in the kidney substance, forming two main and several minor
branches, which pass posteriorly, and empty partly into the vena
hypogastrica, partly into the vena renalis magna, and also into the
vena intervertebralis; other branches empty into the trunk of the
iliaca communis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena suprarenalis externa</b> (Fig. 70, No. 30) is located near
the anterior rim of the kidney and is connected with the vena
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>hypogastrica. It also receives on the medial side, short branches
which come out of the upper kidney surface and sacral vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena ischiatica</b> originates by the union of several venous
branches which come from the muscles of the pelvis and upper
thigh region. The ischiatic vein enters the pelvic cavity along
with the ischiatic nerve and artery, and communicates with the
vena hypogastrica at about the level of the anterior lobe of the
kidney. It is always smaller than the vena cruralis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena obturatoria</b> originates mainly from vessels from the
obturator muscles. It enters the pelvic cavity through the obturator
foramen. Another branch is sometimes found which comes
out of the inner surface of the peritoneum which covers the obturator
muscles and the walls of the abdominal air-sacs and empties
between the vena ischiatica and the vena vertebralis into the
vena hypogastrica.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VEINS OF THE TRUNCUS VENA ILIACA COMMUNIS</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <b>vena intervertebralis lumbalis</b>, which comes out of the
lumbar region, the spinal canal, the lumbo-sacral nerve plexus, and
several small venous branches from the lobes of the kidney. It
passes dorsalward through the kidney and empties into the iliac
vein. There are also communications with the vena intervertebralis
thoracica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena renalis magna</b> (Fig. 64, No. 47) forms the main descending
vein to the middle and posterior lobes of the kidney. It lies
ventrally and mesially on the middle lobe and partly on the inner
part of the posterior lobe. It sometimes has on each side two main
trunks. The vein receives some small vessels out of the anterior
kidney lobe, also other small veins from that part of the peritoneum
which covers the kidney, from the rectum and finally small veins
from the ureter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VISCERAL VEINS OF THE POSTERIOR VENA CAVA</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <b>venæ testiculæ</b>, or the vena ovariana drain the blood from
the testicles of the male and ovary of the female. The size of these
veins change with the enlargement of the testes or of the ovary
during reproductive activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ suprarenales revehentes</b> are short, thick trunks coming
from the adrenal glands. The left empties into the left side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the posterior vena cava and the right into the right dorsal side.
These receive veins from the testicles in the male and from the ovary
in the female.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena proventricularis inferior</b> drains the stomach wall. One
branch of this vein enters the left side of the posterior vena cava;
the other enters the vena proventricularis communis, which in turn
empties into the trunk of the anterior vena cava sinistra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>venæ hepaticæ</b> consist of one large and several small
veins from each lobe of the liver, and empty into the posterior
vena cava.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some small vessels come from the pericardium and the peritoneal
covering of the liver, and pass in the mediastinum to the trunk of
the posterior vena cava.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the region of the vena portalis:</p>

<p class='c007'>The liver receives almost all the blood from the stomach, the
intestines, the pancreatic gland, the spleen, partly from the liver
itself, and partly from the abdominal air-sacs. This blood enters
into the liver through the vena portalis dextra, the vena portalis
sinistra, and the vena portalis propria.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both lobes of the liver these veins divide into numerous small
branches and collect again into two large short trunks, the vena
hepatica magna dextra (Fig. 70, No. 23), coming out of the right
lobe of the liver and the vena hepatica magna sinistra (Fig. 70, No.
24) coming out of the left lobe. These two vessels empty inferiorly
into the posterior vena cava.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vena portalis dextra receives the blood from the vena mesenterica
communis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena mesenterica communis</b> (Fig. 64, No. 36) receives the
blood from the vena coccygo-mesenterica (Fig. 70, No. 28) which
comes from the arcus hypogastricus and receives the vena hemorrhoidalis
(Fig. 64, No. 37). This drains the cloaca and the bursa of
Fabricius, and it also receives veins from the rectum and from the
base of the cæca.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena mesenterica anterior</b> (Fig. 71, No. 3) accompanies the
anterior mesenteric artery, and collects the blood from numerous
vessels from the small intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena pancreatico-duodenalis</b> (Fig. 64, No. 38) comes out of
the duodenum and the pancreas, along the right side of the stomach
and along both cæca.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena proventriculo-lienalis</b> (Fig. 64, No. 39) comes out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the dorsal side of the proventriculus on the left side of the gizzard,
passes along the hilus of the spleen, and takes up several splenic
veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena portalis dextra</b> (Fig. 64, No. 40; Fig. 71, No. 4) receives
a vein near the base of the gall-bladder. This branch enters the
right lobe of the liver and unites with the vena portalis sinistra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena portalis sinistra</b> (Fig. 71, No. 5) enters the left lobe of
the liver and there forms a sinus. It receives vessels which come
from the muscles of the gizzard, the inferior vena proventricularis,
and from the proventricular wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena portalis propria</b> receives small veins which come out of
the walls of the abdominal air-sacs and from the fat of the abdominal
walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vena umbilicalis</b> originates in the umbilical region and empties
into the vena hepatica magna sinistra at a point where it comes out
of the liver (Fig. 70, No. 29). This is the remains of an embryonal
vein which collected all the blood of the yolk sac, passed on the left
side of the large intestine to the body, took up the vena mesenterica
and ended as the vena umphalo-mesenterica.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Lymphatic System</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The peculiarity of the lymph vessels is that they are associated
with organs in which lymph cells are formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymphatic system consists of the lymph vessels and the cell-forming
organs. In some instances the cell-producing organs are
lymph follicles and in others lymph glands. For the most part the
glands are replaced by plexuses which in many places surround the
blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph of birds is similar to that of mammals. The larger
lymph vessels are similar to the veins, although the walls are always
thinner. Its tunica intima is rich in elastic fibers and has a layer
of endothelial cells on the inner side. The tunica media is formed
of rings of smooth muscle fibers. The adventitia is composed of
loose connective tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph vessels frequently form plexuses. The large lymph
trunks follow the course of the larger blood-vessels, and frequently
surround the arteries. All the lymph vessels of the body, exclusive
of the lymph of the caudal region, form into a large trunk which
originates on both sides of the celiaca communis and passes upward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>along the side of the abdominal aorta, reaching a point anterior
to the celiaca. By receiving many vessels in this region it forms a
plexus around the aorta, and finally divides into two vessels, the
right and the left, ducti thoracici.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph vessels of the left side of the head, the neck, and the
lung, and the left wing, and also lymph vessels of the proventriculus
and the throat enter into the left ductus thoracicus. They accompany
the jugular vein and are closely associated with the thyroid
gland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right thoracic duct receives the lymph veins from the right
cervical lymph vein, and the right side of the head, the neck, the
lung, and from the right wing.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the right cervical lymph vein has passed through the right
thyroid gland, it divides into two branches, one branch emptying
into the right thoracic duct and the other into the vena cava dextra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph vessels of the liver, the stomach, the pancreas, and
the duodenum enter near the root of the arteria celiaca into the
large lymph trunk. The lymph vessels of the remainder of the
intestines, of the kidney, and of the generative organs empty farther
caudally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph vessels of the intestines take up the emulsified fat.
This emulsion in birds is colorless. The vessels pass upward along
the mesenteric arteries. There are no mesenteric glands. These
vessels form a plexus around the arteria celiaca. The lymph vessels
of the posterior extremities accompany the artery, especially the
anterior iliaca externa, and empty into the thoracic duct at the
point of the anterior iliaco-communis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph vessels in birds are numerous. The lymph glands are
few. They are only visibly found in the anterior breast and the neck
region, and sometimes in the wings. Lymph follicles are numerous
in the intestines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thin walls of the lacteals, of the lymph vessels, and of the
thoracic duct are made up of two tunics, the inner being the thinner
and weaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymphatics of the foot unite to form the vessels along the sides
of each toe. In palmipedes there are anastomosing branches which
pass from the lateral vessels of one toe to those of the adjoining toe,
forming arches in the uniting web of the foot. These branches form
a small plexus at the anterior part of the digito-metatarsal joint,
from which pass three or four lymph vessels. The anterior and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>internal branches accompany and form a network around the
blood-vessels. The posterior and external branches receive the
lymphatic vessels from the sole of the foot. They then ascend
along the metatarsus and form, at its proximal articulation, a close
network from which vessels pass along the tibial region, forming a
plexus around it as far as the middle of the leg. From this there
arises two branches. The smaller passes along the anterior part of
the depression between the tibia and the fibula, as far as the knee-joint,
where it joins the other branch, which accompanies the blood-vessel.
The trunk formed by the union of these two vessels accompanies
the femoral vessels. Forming plexuses in its course, it
receives tributary vessels from the adjacent muscles. The iliac
trunk accompanies the femoral vein into the abdominal cavity,
entering just in front of the anterior end of the pubis. At this point
it receives branches from the lateral parts of the pelvis and then
separates into two branches. The posterior vessel receives some
lymph from the anterior lobes of the kidney, and from the ovary, or
testis, and communicates anteriorly with a branch formed by the
lymph vessels adjacent to the anterior mesenteric artery, and
posteriorly with a large vesicular plexus surrounding the aorta and
its branches. This plexus receives the lymph from the renal plexus
and from those accompanying the arteria media.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two sacral or pelvic vesicles which are situated at the
angle between the tail and the thigh in the posterior part of the
abdominal cavity. Each vesicle is a trifle more than a half inch
long and a quarter inch wide, and is shaped somewhat like a kidney
bean. They have muscular coats with striated fibers. These sacs
are called “lymph hearts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior division of the femoral lymphatic trunk accompanies
the aorta, on which it forms a plexus with the branches of the
opposite side, and with the intestinal lymph vessels. These vessels
commence from a continuous plexiform network located between
the mucous and the muscular coat of the intestine. They are larger
at this point than where they leave the intestine to pass through the
mesentery. They accompany the trunk of the anterior mesenteric
artery and form a plexus around it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before reaching the region of the aorta, the intestinal lymphatic
vessels communicate with the posterior division of the femoral
trunk and with the lymph vessels of the ovary or of the testis.
After passing to the region of the aorta they receive vessels from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the pancreas and the duodenum, and terminate around the celiac
axis with the lymphatics of the liver, the proventriculus, the gizzard,
and the spleen, forming a rather voluminous plexus (Lauth).</p>

<p class='c007'>The aortic plexus represents the receptaculum chyli and gives
origin to two thoracic ducts, mentioned above, which passing on
each side of the bodies of the vertebræ, pass one right and one left,
over the lungs, from which they receive lymph vessels, and terminate
after receiving the lymph vessels of the wing, into the jugular vein
of their respective sides. The left thoracic duct, before emptying
into the vein, receives the trunk of the lymphatics of the left side of
the neck, and the right duct that of the right side of the neck, each
tributary collecting lymph from all the structures of its side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymphatics of the wing follow the course of the brachial
artery, forming a plexus around it. These vessels are well developed
in the elbow region. The principal trunk, following the humerus,
receives collateral branches in its upper third. This vessel, when
nearing the chest, receives two or three large lymph vessels from
the pectoral muscles, and a branch which accompanies the brachial
plexus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymph vessels of the head accompany the branches of the
jugular vein, collecting the lymph from the structures of the head
and the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lymphatic vessels communicate at the anterior and posterior
oblique anastomosing vessels. At the lower part of the neck each
trunk receives a vessel, which accompanies the carotid arteries.
Further on they are provided with a lymph gland which rests on the
jugular vein.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Blood and Its Functions</span></h4>

<p class='c006'>The special function of the blood is to nourish all the tissues of the
body, and in this way to aid growth and repair. It furnishes material
for the purpose of the elaboration of body secretions; it supplies
the organism with oxygen; and it carries away carbon dioxid and
other effete material. Blood is constantly in circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blood is red, opaque, and is, in the fowl, quite viscid. The
exact tint of the blood depends on whether it is drawn from an artery
or from a vein. Blood from a vein has a purplish tinge while that
from an artery is a bright scarlet. The color of blood is largely due
to pigment in the erythrocyte, called hemoglobin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>reaction of the blood</i> is alkaline, due to the phosphate and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>bicarbonate of soda. The alkalinity of the blood is reduced by work.
This is due to the formation of sarcolactic acid in the muscle. The
odor of blood is due to volatile fatty acids. Each kind of fowl
has its own peculiar odor. The taste of the blood is saltish, due
to a small amount of sodium chlorid it contains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blood consists of the following substances:</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the unorganized part, or fluid, the liquor <i>sanguinis</i> or
<i>plasma</i>. It contains in solution proteids, extractives, mineral matter,
and gases. The gases are held in loose chemical union.</p>

<p class='c007'>The liquor sanguinis constitutes fully 66 per cent. of the volume
of the blood. It is albuminous in nature and contains a small
amount of coloring matter of a fatty nature. It holds in solution
three proteids—fibrinogen, serum globulin, and serum albumin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, the organized parts, or the cellular structure (Fig. 74,
Nos. 1 to 21). The cells float in the plasma and consist of three
groups: the erythrocytes, or red blood cells, the leucocytes, or white
blood cells, and the thrombocytes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Erythrocytes.</b>—The average number of red cells (Fig. 74, No. 21)
of the domestic fowl range between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 per
cubic millimeter. The red blood cells are flattened and elliptical
in shape, and possess an oval elliptical nucleus. The average
length is ¹⁄₂₁₀₀ inch and the diameter ¹⁄₃₈₀₀ inch, or 7 to 8 micra
in diameter and 12 to 13 micra in length. However the diameters
vary in different kinds of birds. The cytoplasm is yellow and glassy,
and the nucleus takes basic stains and appears somewhat picnotic.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Thrombocytes.</b>—The thrombocyte (Fig. 74, No. 19) is of about the
same length as the erythrocyte but somewhat narrower. The nucleus
is round, stains purple with the Wright’s stain, and the chromatin
material is somewhat diffused. The diameter of the nucleus is
nearly equal to that of the cell. The cytoplasm is pale and may
show vacuoles near the nucleus. They may contain small circumscribed
red structures. They vary somewhat in size and shape.
There are in the domestic fowl between 45,000 and 55,000 per cubic
millimeter.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Leucocytes.</b>—There are, in the blood of the hen, 28,000 to 35,000
leucocytes per cubic millimeter. The leucocytes may be divided
into five distinct types. These are as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Polymorphonuclear leucocytes</i> with eosinophilic rods (Fig. 74, No.
2) are round and have a diameter about equal to the length of the
erythrocyte. The nucleus is polymorphous; that is, it has two or
more lobes. The nucleus stains a pale blue, and the chromatin is
diffused. The cytoplasm is colorless with bright red staining spindle-shaped
rods. There are 28 to 32 per cent. of this type of cell in
the blood of the hen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Polymorphonuclear leucocytes with eosinophilic granules (Fig.
74, No. 3 and 4) are of about the same shape and size as the preceding.
The nucleus is similar to the former except that it may
appear slightly picnotic. The cytoplasm stains not at all or faintly
blue; it contains round or spherical granules which stain a dull
red. There is from 4 to 6 per cent. of this type of eosinophiles found
in the domestic fowl.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Lymphocytes</i> are round in shape and of about the diameter of the
width of a thrombocyte (Fig. 74, No. 11). The nucleus is round,
staining somewhat purple, and contains a diffused chromatin material.
The cytoplasm exists in only small amounts; it lies to the side of the
nucleus and stains a pale blue. This is the small lymphocyte. A
similar cell but much larger also exists. This is the large lymphocyte
(Fig. 74, No. 13). There is from 40 to 44 per cent. of the lymphocytes
in the blood of the fowl. The small lymphocytes are most
abundant.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Large mononuclear cells</i> (Fig. 74, No. 6) either round or oval,
in shape, whose diameter may be about that of an erythrocyte and
at times much larger. The nucleus may be round, oval, or irregular,
and at times rather crescent or U-shaped (Fig. 74, No. 17). The
cytoplasm is abundant and completely surrounds the nucleus. The
cytoplasm stains a paler blue than the nucleus. Both taking the
basic stain as do the lymphocytes. These constitute 18 to 20 per
cent. of the cells of the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mast cells</i> or <i>basophiles</i> (Fig. 74, No. 1) are of about the same
size and shape as the eosinophiles. The nucleus is round or oval,
and stains a very pale blue. The cytoplasm is colorless, mostly to
one side of the nucleus, and contains round or spherical purple staining
granules. This type of cell constitutes from 2 to 4 per cent. of
the white cells of the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Structure of the Red Blood Cell.</b>—The red blood cell is composed
of a spongy stroma holding in its meshes the red coloring matter.
The stroma, or framework, of the erythrocyte consists principally
of nucleo-albumin; it contains lecithin, cholesterin, and salts. The
red matter consists of an albuminous crystalline substance called
hemoglobin, which forms about 90 per cent. of the total solid matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of the dried corpuscle. Each red cell offers a certain absorbing surface
for oxygen. As the blood circulates through the delicate walls
of the lungs and the air-sacs, it takes up oxygen; the blood at the
same time delivers to the air carbon dioxid which has been brought
from the tissues where active cell metabolism has been going on.
This oxygen taken up by the erythrocyte forms a loose chemical
union and is known as oxy-hemoglobin. In this form it is carried
to the tissues of the body where it is given up by the erythrocyte to
the tissues where oxidation is going on.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Hemoglobin</i> is a crystallizable proteid substance containing carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and iron.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the Cells of the Blood.</b>—The red blood cells are
formed in the red marrow of the bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Polymorphonuclear leucocytes are formed in the red marrow of
the bones, and the lymphocytes in the lymph glands and lymph
follicles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bird carries a normal body temperature of 105° to 107° F.
The average temperature of 50 mature hens and cocks was 106.8° F.
The blood is of a deep red color.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Composition of the Blood.</b>—The average composition of the blood
of the domestic fowl as given by Owen, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Blood when drawn and allowed to stand soon coagulates. In
the blood of birds this process is very rapid, the blood coagulating,
in most instances, in about one-half minute. Blood coagulates only
in the presence of calcium salts.</p>

<p class='c007'>During life, the liquor sanguinis is termed plasma; but after it
has been shed from the body and coagulation has taken place, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>liquid residue is called serum. Serum is plasma with its modifications
as the result of coagulation, and as this latter process is
brought about by the production of fibrin, we may say that serum is
plasma minus fibrin-forming elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proteids of the serum are serum globulin, serum albumin,
and a ferment produced as the result of coagulation. As fibrinogen
is used up in the process of coagulation, it is not found in the serum,
but there is in the serum a proteid known as fibrino-globulin. This
is produced from fibrinogen during the process of fibrin formation.
The following tabulation gives a clear idea of the difference between
the proteids of plasma and of those of serum:</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE FATE OF THE ERYTHROCYTE OF THE FOWL</h3>

<p class='c015'>The power of vascular endothelium to ingest red blood corpuscles
has been studied by Keys.</p>

<p class='c007'>When bacteria or other minute foreign bodies are injected into
the blood stream of pigeons, they are rapidly withdrawn from the
circulation into the tissues of the liver and of the spleen. The
foreign bodies are noted to be contained within cells of a distinct
type, which is found in both liver and spleen. This type of cell
contains, in addition to the foreign substances injected, much yellow
pigment, and when tested for iron by Pearl’s method gives a positive
Prussian-blue reaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such specimens there is a display of contrast to other tissues.
There is an extensive content of cells possessing the distinct tone of
Prussian-blue iron reaction. These cells are distributed rather
evenly throughout both the spleen and the liver, but more numerously
in the liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the liver, under low-power magnification, these cells appear as
blue patches, sharply differentiated from the red-stained parenchyma.
These cells are larger in their greater diameter than the liver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>cells. They vary much in size and form. They bear a constant
relationship to the venous capillaries, and often appear to occupy
the lumen of the vessels. Under higher magnification it is noted,
however, that each cell is an integral part of the endothelial intima
lining of the capillaries. They are therefore fixed tissue cells, engaged
by one of its surfaces upon the reticulum of the vessel wall,
with a free surface bulging a greater or less degree into the lumen
of the vessel. The attached surface of the cell follows exactly the
line of the vessel wall. These cells are similar to those described
for mammals by Kupffer and are called Kupffer cells or stellate
cells. In the fowl Keys proposes the name hemophages. The
nucleus of the hemophage stains a deep garnet with the carmine used
in the above-given technic, and contains two or three very distinct
and intensely stained nucleoli. In the hemophages, which are
more nearly flat, the nucleus appears like those of the typical endothelial
cells; whereas in the protruding hemophages of greater bulk,
the nucleus is more vesicular and is irregularly pyramidal in form.
Rarely two nuclei are found in one cell. Within this cell may be
seen vacuoles of the cytoplasm which contain red blood corpuscles.
These blood corpuscles have been phagocyted from the circulating
blood stream. Approximately one-third of the intimal cells are
hemophages. Each hemophage displays evidence that it contains,
or has recently contained, one or more red blood cells. The cell body
of the hemophage has no fixed morphology, but changes from time
to time according to its phase of phagocytic activity. In a stage
which the hemophage has recently ingested a red blood cell, the
cell body bulges out into the lumen of the vessel and the nucleus is
crowded to one side. At this time the red blood cell appears as
those in the blood stream and possesses the characteristic staining
reactions. The nucleus of the red blood cell stains deep reddish
brown and the cytoplasm an even yellow bronze. In the next stage
the cytoplasm of the hemophage gives a diffuse Prussian-blue reaction.
Then in hemophages which represent later stages there are
various stages of disintegration and digestion of the red blood cell.
The first changes of the phagocyted red blood cell is hemolysis, the
hemoglobin escaping into vacuoles of the cytoplasm of the phagocytic
cell, leaving the nucleus-containing stroma distinctly outlined.
The stroma may retain the original ovoid form or may become spherical;
the nucleus in such instances remains ovoid. Gradually, both
the stroma and nucleus lose their staining reaction until finally the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>vacuoles contract about a small indistinct remnant of the nucleus,
which in its turn ultimately disappears. During this latter process
the size of the hemophage gradually decreases. The hemoglobin,
which has escaped into the cytoplasm of the hemophage, is seen to
undergo a series of changes. At first the greater part of the pigment
does not give the iron reaction but retains its yellow-bronze tone
with erythrosin and occupies vacuoles of various sizes. Later the
contents of the vacuoles give the iron reaction and with increasing
intensity. Later there is a gradual decrease in the staining reaction
indicating that the iron gradually disappears from the cells which
extracted it from the red blood cells it digests. As a summary we
find, that these cells take care of the worn out red blood cells. They
devour them; hemolyze them, destroying the stroma and nucleus;
split the hemoglobin and free the iron; and then finally return to
their normal form.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spleen contains the same type cells, but they are fewer in
number. For the most part they are confined to the pulp cords and
have no such evident relation to the vessel wall, or lumen, as in the
liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The function of the cells of the spleen are essentially the same as
those in the liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Iron freed from the worn out red blood cells is not retained by the
cells freeing it, nor is it found in the bile. It does not occur elsewhere
in the tissues of the liver and spleen. It is possibly discharged
into the blood stream, and transported to the hemapoietic tissues.
Cells which hemolyze red blood cells and liberate the iron are to be
seriously thought  of in connection with bile formation since bilirubin
is approximately, if not identical with, iron-free hematoidon.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The Nervous System.</b>—The nervous system is an apparatus by
means of which animals appreciate and become influenced by impressions
from the outer world. Animals react on these impressions,
and thus are enabled to adapt themselves to their environment.
This system is the organic substratum of life, sensation, and motion.
Broadly stated, the nervous system connects the various parts of
the body with each other, and to coördinate the parts into a harmonious
whole in order to carry on the bodily functions methodically
and to control the physiological division of labor throughout the
organism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nervous system consists of two parts. The first is the <i>cerebro-spinal
system</i>, which comprises the central nervous axis, including
the brain and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nerves, including
the cranial and the spinal nerves. The second is the <i>sympathetic
nervous system</i>. The two parts of the system are closely linked
together, and both terminate in peripheral nerve endings, including
those of special sense, of sensation, and of motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cerebro-spinal nerves especially preside over the special senses,
motion and sensation; and the sympathetic over the digestive,
the pulmonary, and the vascular apparatus.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a structural standpoint, the nerve system consists of cell
elements peculiarly differentiated from all other tissue cells in that
their protoplasm is extended in the form of processes, often to great
distances from the nuclear region. The cell elements are held in
place by supporting tissue and receive an abundant blood supply;
they are partly of ectodermal and partly of mesodermal origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cell element of the nerve system, called a <i>neurone</i>, is the
developmental, structural, and functional unit of the nervous
system. It is a single cell presenting unusual structural modifications.
It comprises not only the nerve cell body with its numerous
protoplasmic processes, or dendrites, but also the axone, which may
vary in length from a fraction of a millimeter to fully half the bird’s
length. The bulk of the axone is many times the bulk of the cell
body.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Certain non-medullated axones are surrounded by a delicate,
homogeneous, nucleated sheath, called the neurilemma, or sheath of
Schwann.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE CRANIAL NERVES</h3>

<p class='c015'>The cranial nerves have their origin in the brain and leave the
cranial cavity in pairs. They are numbered numerically from before
backward, there being twelve pairs in all. The following is a tabulation

<p class='c007'><b>Olfactorius.</b>—Nervus olfactorius (Fig. 75, <i>C</i>, 16). This is the
nerve of smell, one of the nerves of special sense. The organ of
smell consists of five layers as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>First, a layer of olfactory fibers extending in different directions
and consisting of a dense plexiform arrangement of the axones of
the olfactory cells. From this layer the fibers pass into the layer
of olfactory glomeruli where their terminal ramifications mingle
with the dendritic terminals of cells lying in the more dorsal layers,
to form distinctly outlined spheroidal or oval nerve fiber nests, the
<i>olfactory glomeruli</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, a fine granular layer of basic substance containing round
cellular structures, the <i>stratum granulosum</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third, broader granular, or molecular layer, having on its inner
surface a row of large pyramidal cells which are both small and large
and which send their dendrites into the olfactory glomeruli. Their
points are directed outward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth, a layer of round cells tightly pressed together and measuring
about 5 microns in diameter. Between these cells are very
fine nerve fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Fifth, a layer of epithelial cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peripheral fibers and the nerve cell layers near the hemispheres
disappear so that the basic substance of the trabecula
with the hemispheres form the entire lobe mass. On the lower
surface of the hemispheres there is a long bundle of nerve fibers
which enter into the substance of the olfactory lobes and there
disappears. These fibers are medullated. Non-medullated fibers
enter into the makeup of the olfactory trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The original center of the olfactory nerve is not in the hemisphere,
but in the same location as the optic nerve. This nerve trunk consists
of very fine non-medullated fibers. The nerves of smell are
therefore not peripheralistic nerves. The nerve fibers are distributed
to the mucous surface of the turbinated bones. Toward the front
they form an expanded prolongation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The olfactory nerve, as it emerges from the cone-like anterior tip
of the cerebrum, is of considerable thickness and extends along with
the median dorsal artery of that region above and to the inside of
the orbit, under the thin bony structure. Before its termination
into the posterior turbinated bones, it is crossed by the superior
maxillary division of the fifth pair of cranial nerves. It extends as
far as the pituitary membrane of the turbinate bones upon which its
filaments are distributed radially.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Opticus.</b>—The nervus opticus (Fig. 75, No. <i>C</i>, 14) the second
cranial, is the nerve of sight. The optic lobe, or tuberculum
bigeminum lies at the base of the brain on each side of the optic
tract.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the optic lobes the two trunks pass forward along the under
surface of the cerebri, forming the optic chiasm at the hypophysis
(Fig. 75, No. <i>C</i>, 15), at which point the nerve fibers originating from
the right side pass to the left, and <i>vice versǎ</i>. From the chiasm the
true optic nerves pass forward to the posterior surface of the eyeball.
They are composed of a bundle of very fine, marrow-like nerves.
These fibers enter into the ganglionic cells of the retina. By removal
of the finely adherent neurilemma, the optic nerve is seen to
be composed of parallel, longitudinal lamellæ, the margins of which
are mostly free on one side.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Motor Oculi.</b>—The motor oculi (Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 10), the
third cranial nerve is a motor nerve. It originates close to the
base of the brain behind the position of the hippocampus of mammals
on the inner side of the crus cerebri, and also on the inner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>somatic column close below and somewhat aside from the aqueduct
of Sylvius. The nerve leaves the brain cavity through a distinct
foramen near the foramen opticum, and supplies the following eye
muscles: first, after entering the orbit, it sends a branch upward
to the inferior portion of the inferior rectus; then, it gives off the
thick ramus ciliaris. The trunk then extends under the optic
nerve and passes forward to innervate the inferior rectus, the
internal rectus, and the inferior oblique. A ciliary ganglion forms
on the trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Patheticus.</b>—(Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 11) is a small motor nerve,
originating close to the sulcus centralis, in the circle of the center
brain over the valve of Vieussens, between the posteriors of the
optic lobes. It extends in a dorsal direction between the cerebellum
and the lobus opticus, to the posterior of the latter of
which it then forms a loop ventrally. Lying close to the optic
foramen it passes through a fine opening into the eye cavity and
supplies the superior oblique muscle of the eye. During its course
it passes dorsally over the optic nerve, and then crosses dorsally
over the ophthalmic division of the fifth pair of cranial nerves and
the internal rectus muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Trifacialis.</b>—(Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 12). This, the fifth cranial,
is a mixed nerve and is divided into two parts, portio major and
portio minor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>portio major</i> originates in the ganglion cells of the posterior
part of the brain. Commencing near the medulla oblongata it
passes through the posterior part of the brain, then upward and
outward; and along its route it forms the Gasserian ganglion, which
lies partly in the cranial cavity or in its wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>portio minor</i> consists of the downward passing fibers containing
the motoric elements which are distributed to the muscles of the
jaw and of the eye. The roots are found in the ganglion from the
center and back brain, close below the pathetic nerve origin, where
the pathetic passes between the lobus opticus and the pars peduncularis;
it then takes a lateral course between the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fibers of the portio minor do not take part in the formation
of the Gasserian ganglion, but are only partly surrounded by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three nerve trunks given off of the trifacialis: the ophthalmic,
the superior maxillary, and the inferior maxillary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ophthalmic division</i> of the fifth nerve is the smallest of the
three branches. It emerges directly from the Gasserian ganglion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and passes through a narrow bony canal in the base of the brain,
below the pathetic and the abducens, and through the foramen
ophthalmicum. It then enters the eye cavity above the optic nerve,
and on the wall of the cavity extends downward, and with regard
to the eyeball, dorsally lying close to the rectus internus muscle
and close to the surface of the eyeball. It passes along the olfactory
nerve, extends under the superior oblique muscle, and finally
reaches the inner angle, or canthus, of the eye. It here divides into
the recurrent externa and the ethmoidalis. The ethmoidalis branch
is a straight continuation of the ophthalmic. It extends along close
to its fellow of the opposite side, and, over the vomer, splits into two
branches. The smaller of these branches breaks through the bone
cells of the jaw, continues upon its ventral surface in a furrow extending
forward, and terminates in the gum region. It supplies the
gum and point of the beak. The larger branch enters into the cell
substance extending to the tip of the beak, in its course sending
out a number of fine filaments, which spread out along the outer
surface. At this point these two branches may fuse. The larger
branch is endowed with the sense of touch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recurrent externa divides shortly after leaving the main trunk
of the eye cavity passes over the lacrimal gland. It gives two
branches to this gland and one to the membrana nictitans, and
innervates the upper eyelid. It then emerges from the eye cavity,
passing over the os lacrimale, and gives one or more branches to
the integument of this region, including the comb. This branch
is large in birds with a large comb. Branches pass in front of the
lacrimal bone through the outer nasal cavity and into its deeper
structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the ophthalmic branch has entered into the eye
cavity and before it crosses the optic nerve, it gives a fine branch
to the motor occuli.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second and the third branches of the fifth cranial nerve are
mixed. They contain elements of both the portio major and the
portio minor. These two branches come from the lower part of the
outer region of the ganglion, and pass together through a cavity
which is located between the os petrosum and alæ and basis sphenoid,
and then branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ramus secundus, or <i>superior maxillary division</i>, of the trifacial,
is the second branch and passes into the orbit below the
optic nerve and the eyeball. It is called the recurrent infra-orbitale.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>It gives an ascending branch to the gland of Harder, one to the
conjunctiva, one to the membrana nictitans, and one to the eyelids.
It also gives a branch to the skin below the eye and to the angle
of the mouth. This latter branch is called the <i>recurrent subcutaneous</i>.
These two branches communicate with the recurrent nasal ciliaris
of the first trigeminus branch. The second branch passes below the
nasal opening, then passes on and forms the alveolar nerve on the side
between the gums. It sends several recurrent posterior branches
to the elevations on the back part of the mouth. It extends forward
to the point of the beak.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>inferior maxillary division</i> of the fifth is larger than the
other two. It is directed downward and outward then upward to
the temporal region. At the temporal region it divides into five
parts. It gives a branch to the temporalis muscle, one to the
pterygoid muscle, and one to the mylo-hyoideus. The main branch
gives twigs to the parotid gland region and enters into the dental
canal of the lower jaw. Numerous filaments break through the
lower jaw bone, and then spread out on the skin and rim of that bone.
The largest branch, called the recurrent maxillaris externa, comes
out near the coronoid process. The rest of the trunk extends to,
and comes out of, several foramina at the anterior point of the jaw
bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>These filaments are contained in grooves or cavities of the
lower jaw and terminate in touch buds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trifacialis fuses with the other cranial nerves and with the
sympathetic nervous system. Some of these fusions are as follows:
The recurrent ophthalmica fuses with the orbito-nasalis ganglion.
Indirect fusion of the recurrent maxillary division of this nerve
takes place near the Gasserian ganglion through the sympathetic
nerves, the temporo-lacrimalis, the facial nerves, the large cervical
ganglion, and indirectly with the glosso-pharyngeal and the vagus.
This fusion has been called the superior recurrent branch of the
trigeminus, or trifacialis.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a direct fusion of the superior recurrent maxillary division
of the fifth just before entering the upper jaw. This fusion
is with the spheno-palatine ganglion and the sympathetic carotidis
cephalica, and also with the large cervical ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Abducens</b> (Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 13).—This nerve originates in the
somatic and motoric column along with the other nerves of the eye
muscles. Its nucleus lies in the circle of the pars commissuralis of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the cerebellum. The nerve then passes ventrally, as does the motoris
oculi and leaves the brain along the median line. This is a
comparatively large nerve and passes somewhat laterally and
ventrally from the foramen opticum through a canal in the sphenoid.
It then enters the orbital cavity. Some muscular twigs are given
off to the quadratus and to the pyramidalis muscle. This nerve
also innervates the external rectus muscle of the eye. The abducens
anastomoses with the ramus ciliaris and the ophthalmic nerve
and gives fine nerve twigs to the ramus ciliaris externus of the ciliary
ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Facialis and the Acusticus.</b>—The facial nerve originates with
the auditory (Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 14 and 15) in a very vaguely known
manner, from the cerebellum. It divides into three parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of these probably comes from the complex ganglion with
the posterior roots of the auditory. This part belongs to the somatic
sensory group of nerves. From this same group originates the auditory,
which spreads out into the cochlea and takes the impressions
of sound. This nerve is short and thick, and, at the point where it
loses its medullary covering on entering the cochlea, there is developed
a ganglion. This ganglion is similar to the spinal ganglia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second part is provided with one root which originates mesially
and ventrally, from the deeper ganglion cells. Some of the
fibers from this root constitute the vestibular branches. They
accompany the auditory and supply the anterior part of the ear
labyrinth and the semicircular canals. The larger part of the
fibers of this trunk make up the intermediate part of the facial.
The geniculate ganglion is formed at their fusion. The sympathetic
spheno-palatine nerve emerges from this ganglion, coming out of the
aqueduct of Fallopius.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third part, called the portio dura, is the main facialis. It is
located opposite the auditoria intermedia. Its roots may be traced
to the complex ganglion, from which they take a direction ventrally
from the median portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facialis, after emerging from the aqueduct of Fallopius,
takes a curved course and partly fuses with the sympathetic temporo-lacrimalis
on the upper posterior wall of the ear drum. It is here
accompanied by the carotid and the cephalic arteries. It leaves
the ear drum through an opening in the quadrate bone, giving off a
large branch to the digastricus muscle and a small one to the stapedius
of the columella auris. The facialis trunk is quite large. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>then passes downward along the quadrate bone, where it receives a
large branch from the glosso-pharyngeus. This nerve also gives
branches to the mylo-hyoideus and the stylo-hyoideus muscle, crosses
laterally the glosso-pharyngeus, and finally fuses with branches
of the subcutaneous and with the first, the second, the third, and
the fourth cervical nerves. After this fusion the nerves innervate
the skin of the anterior of the neck and the constrictor colli muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facialis anastomoses as follows: with a fine branch of the
sympathetic temporo-lacrimalis, indirectly with the ramus trigeminus,
with the large cervical nerve ganglion and with the spheno-palatine
ganglion and nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Vagus Group.</b>—The ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh cranial
nerves are by some anatomists called the vagus group, first so
called by Willis. They are made up of both sensory and motor
nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Glosso-pharyngeus.</b>—The roots of the glosso-pharyngeus (Fig.
62, No. <i>C</i>, 16; Fig. 76, No. 13) emerge, along with those of the vagus,
from the medulla oblongata, and enter, as a short trunk, the foramen
jugulare et caroticum. Between these two nerves there is usually
found a thin portion of bone. The trunk of the glosso-pharyngeus
forms a ganglion in the foramen jugulare et caroticum where it
receives connecting branches from the near-by ganglion radicis and
vagus nerve. The glosso-pharyngeus passes out of the foramen
jugulare et caroticum above the large superior sympathetic nerve ganglion,
with which it communicates. The glosso-pharyngeus passes
diagonally over the ramus temporo-lacrimalis of the sympathetic
system, and then receives a very strong branch from the vagus (Fig.
76, No. 12). It sends a short branch to the recurrent lacrimalis of
the sympathetic system. At this point there is formed a reddish-yellow
ganglion, the petrosal ganglion, which is similar to the petrosal
ganglion of mammals. Frequently it is found close below the large
superior cervical nerve ganglion. The petrosal ganglion is frequently
connected by special fibers with the cervical nerve ganglion,
the large superior cervical nerve ganglion and the ganglion radicis
vagi. The glosso-pharyngeus is divided into the following branches.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the recurrent pharyngeus which gives branches to the upper
part of the throat and which is tortuous in its course. It receives
a branch from the superior cervical nerve ganglion and gives off
branches to the salivary glands and papillæ of the posterior tongue
region.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Second, the recurrent lingualis, which passes with the lingual
artery over the hyoid bone to the base of the tongue and to the
papillæ. Another branch passes below the tongue bone and supplies
the tongue and the pharynx. The glosso-pharyngeal is a mixed
nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Vagus.</b>—The vagus, or pneumogastricus (Fig. 18, No. 5;
Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 17; Fig. 76, No. 12), a mixed nerve, forms a ganglion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>in the foramen through which it passes. The foramen lies between
the os petrosum and os occipitale, close to the foramen jugulare,
above and to the inside of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ganglionic root of the vagus communicates with the superior
cervical nerve ganglion. The vagus, after coming out of the foramen,
takes up branches of the spinal accessory, passes to the superior
nerve ganglion, crosses the carotid artery, and then, accompanied
by the internal jugular, it connects by a branch with the hypoglossal.
It then communicates with the petrosal ganglion, and receives a
long branch from the superior cervical ganglion. It then extends
along the neck with the jugular vein and often fuses with the sympathetic
ganglionic plexuses. As it passes, it is interwoven with the
glosso-pharyngeus, but each nerve element retains its own individuality.
Extending down the neck, on entering the thoracic cavity,
it lies between the plexus brachialis and the carotid artery. Then
it passes below the subclavian artery, and between the bronchial
tubes, the aorta pulmonalis, and the subclavian vein. Then ventrally
it rests upon the glands, and the right and the left vagi fuse
or unite. From here they radiate down to the stomach in fan-shape,
and, continuing, they fuse with the sympathetic system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other branches of the vagus are:</p>

<p class='c007'>The first branch is the recurrent laryngeus, which supplies the
lower end of the bronchial tubes, and the esophagus, then enters
above the bronchus near the origin of the subclavian artery as the
recurrent cardiacus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second are the recurrent pulmonale which pass into the lungs,
each fusing with its fellow from the opposite side, and giving off
branches inferior to the vena cava including a branch to the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third are the recurrent hepatici which pass through the diaphragm
and are distributed to the liver.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Accessorius Spinalis.</b>—This is a very small motor nerve
(Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 18). It comes out between the dorsal and the ventral
root of the third cervical nerve. It lies close to the neck and extends
anteriorly, receiving roots from the first and the second cervical
nerve. It passes through the occipital foramen into the brain cavity
and then enters the ganglion radicis vagi. It passes out of the cranial
cavity through the foramen jugulare. It then partly fuses with the
vagus and partly, as a fine branch, with the subcutaneous colli.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Hypoglossus.</b>—The hypoglossus is a motor nerve (Fig. 62,
No. <i>C</i>, 19). It originates anterior to the eleventh pair of cranial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>nerves, and from the same ganglion as the abducens and the motor
oculi. It leaves the medulla oblongata from its ventral surface, and
passes with a posterior and an anterior branch out of the cranial
cavity through two separate foramina in the os occipitale laterale.
The posterior branch, much smaller than the anterior, passes between
the cranial bones and the cervical sympathetic nerve; it then passes
at right angles through the rectus capitis anticus, and, while closely
following the carotid artery, it fuses with the anterior branch.
The larger, anterior branch, much stronger than the posterior, sends
a short strong branch to the complexus muscle. The rest of this
branch, which probably has sympathetic elements, is disposed as is
a spinal nerve. It crosses the sympathetic nerve, and at this point
forms a typical cervical sympathetic ganglion. It also forms a
short loop with the recurrent ventralis of the first cervical plexus.
From this loop, after it has given off several branches to the
muscles of the neck, it gives off one or two strong branches, which
fuse with each other and with the posterior thin branch, thus forming
the trunk of the hypoglossus. It receives many elements from
the first cervical nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypoglossus sometimes communicates with the vagus, crosses
over the latter, and divides itself into two main branches, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the <i>recurrent laryngo-lingualis</i>, which passes between the
cornua of the os hyoideum and the larynx to the anterior part,
and furnishes the principal tongue muscles. It extends along the
inferior surface of the tongue and fuses with the one of the other
side and extends to the free tip of the tongue. This nerve probably
receives sensory elements from the second root and from the confluent
of the first cervical nerve. This form of anastomosis is well
marked in birds with thick tongues, as ducks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, the <i>recurrent laryngeus</i> furnishes the muscles of the superior
larynx and of the tongue skeleton. It extends downward
and also furnishes the muscles of the trachea. It follows the course
of the jugular vein and at the entrance of the chest supplies the furcula.
The nerve passes into the thorax, downward along the side of
the bronchial tubes, and supplies innervation to all the muscles of
the inferior larynx.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE SPINAL CORD</h3>

<p class='c015'><b>Structure of the Cord.</b>—The spinal cord is called the myelon or
medulla spinalis. It is a comparatively large, white, irregularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>cylindrical cord, flattened from above downward. It extends from
the foramen magnum at the base of the medulla to the caudal portion
of the spinal canal where it terminates in a fine filament. In order
to allow considerable motion of the spinal column without danger of
injury to the spinal cord, the cord is loosely suspended in the canal.
The meninges, or coverings, are continued from the brain. In addition
to these there are to be found arteries, veins, and nerves entering
and others making their exit from the canal and from the
cord. At the cervico-dorsal juncture, where the brachial plexus
is given off, the cord is enlarged. There is another enlargement at
the point where the lumbo-sacral plexus is given off. At this point,
superiorly, there is a longitudinal cavity called the <i>sinus rhomboidalis</i>.
This sinus contains a gelatinous substance. There is a pair
of nerves given off at each intervertebral foramen. Thus there are
as many pairs of spinal nerves as there are vertebral segments. The
inferior root is the motor root and carries the impulses from the
cord to the periphery. The superior root is the sensory branch
and carries the impulses from the periphery to the cord, and thence
the impulse is carried to the centers in the brain. The sensory
and the motor roots are of about equal size. The inferior have more
numerous filaments. The ganglion on the superior or sensory root
is relatively large. In the sacral region the sensory and the motor
branches pass through their own bony canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>White <i>rami communicantes</i> are given off at each intervertebral
foramen to the sympathetic system and gray rami are received from
the sympathetic ganglia. Thus there is established a direct communication
between the sympathetic and the spinal system. There is a
ganglion on the superior root just outside the spinal cord.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ganglionic portion, or <i>gray matter</i>, is arranged in the center
of the cord in two comma-shaped parts forming an X. The white
matter, or the material forming the fibers, is arranged around the
central ganglionic portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spinal cord may be divided into two lateral symmetrical
halves. There are two longitudinal fissures, one on the upper and
the other on the lower half. The upper called the <i>superior median
fissure</i> is narrow but deep. The one on the inferior side, called the
<i>inferior median</i>, is usually more pronounced. The superior parts
of the gray matter are called the superior cornua, or horns; the
inferior parts the inferior cornua, or horns. The center of the cord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>is pierced by a <i>central canal</i> which communicates with the fourth
ventricle at the calamus scriptorius.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>STRUCTURE OF THE NERVE TRUNKS AND GANGLIA</h3>

<p class='c015'>The protoplasmic processes called <i>dendrites</i> have a similar structure
to the cell body. The dendrites branch dichotomously, become
rapidly smaller, and usually end at no great distance from the cell
body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>axone</i> or <i>axis cylinder process</i>, differs from the cell body and
from the dendrites. It does not contain chromophilic granules.
It consists entirely of neurofibrils and perifibrillar substance. It
emerges from the cell at an enlargement known as the axone hill.
This hill is free from chromophilic bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nerves are divided into two kinds, medullated and non-medullated.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Medullated nerves</i> are divided into two kinds: medullated nerves
with a neurolemma, and medullated nerves without a neurolemma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Medullated nerves with a neurolemma consists of an axone, a
medullary sheath, and a neurolemma. A delicate membrane called
an axolemma, or periaxial sheath envelops the axone. The medullary
sheath called myelin, is semifluid, somewhat resembling fat. The
outer covering is the neurolemma, or sheath of Schwann. It is a
delicate, structureless membrane which incloses the myelin. There
is under this sheath an occasional oval nucleus. At intervals there
are constrictions, or nodes, called the constrictions of Ranvier. The
part between the nodes is called the internode.</p>

<p class='c007'>The medullated axones without a neurolemma are the medullated
nerve fibers of the central nervous system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The non-medullated axones, or <i>non-medullated nerve fibers</i>, are
divided into non-medullated axones with and those without, a neurolemma.</p>

<p class='c007'>The non-medullated axone without a neurolemma is merely a naked
axone. They are confined to the gray matter and to the beginnings
and endings of sheath axones, all the latter being uncovered for a
short distance after leaving the nerve cell body and also just before
reaching their terminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The long axones serve to make connections with the peripheral,
or distant, nerve cell, muscle cell, or gland cell; while the shorter
axones of certain neurones divide into terminal branches in the
immediate vicinity of its cell body, presumably to come into relation
with other nerve cells in the same or adjacent groups.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Neurones</i> are devoted to the maintenance of functions. Reproductive
neurones are so arranged as to receive afferent nerve impulses
from other tissues; emissive neurones give off efferent nerve impulses.
The former are sensory neurones; the latter are motor neurones
if connected with muscles, and excito-glandular if connected with
gland cells. The basis, then, of the nerve system is a series of neurones,
with projecting and association processes, coördinated for
the purpose of performing specific actions manifested either by
motion, by trophic changes, or by the apperception of stimuli of
a chemic, mechanic (tactile and auditory), thermal, or photic nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole of the nerve structure is composed of the nerve tissue
and supporting connective tissue. The neurones constitute the
nerve tissue, while the supportive tissue is composed of neuroglia
and of white fibrous tissue derived either from the investing membrane
or from the sheaths of its numerous vascular channels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The neurones, or nerve cells, exhibit marked variations as to external
characters, dimensions, and form. The neurone presents a
swollen cell mass and a nucleus; it is known as the ganglion cell.
From this cell body are given off a number of processes of two distinct
kinds: first, protoplasmic processes, which are commonly
branched, called dendrites; second, a single, thinner, and paler process;
the axis cylinder process.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>The bodies of cells vary in size from 4 to 100 microns or more in
diameter. The largest cells occur in the inferior horn of the spinal
cord, in the spinal ganglia, in the large pyramidal cell layer of the
cerebral cortex, in the Purkinjean cell layer of the cerebellum, and
in Clark’s column of the spinal cord. Very small cells occur in the
olfactory bulbs, in the granular layer of the cerebral and cerebellar
cortex, and in the gliosum cornuale of the cord.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nerve cells are classified according to the number of processes
arising from the cell body, and neurones are referred to as unipolar,
bipolar, and multipolar.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Unipolar cells</i> are met with frequently in early stages of embryonic
development, but are rare in adults, occurring only in the
retina, in the olfactory bulb, and within the baskets of the Purkinjean
cells of the cerebellum. The cells of the cerebro-spinal
ganglia, except the cochlear and vestibular, are apparently unipolar,
but they are developmentally and functionally of bipolar
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bipolar cells</i> are found almost exclusively in the peripheral sensory
system, as in the olfactory membrane, in the retina, in the cochlear
and vestibular ganglia, and in the cerebro-spinal ganglia of the
embryo.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Multipolar cells</i> are the most numerous and form the principal
elements of nerve centers throughout the system. They are termed
multipolar because of the greater or lesser number of dendrites
given off in addition to the single axone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of the nerve cell consists of a mass of protoplasm surrounding
a nucleus. The cytoplasm of the nerve cell consists of
two distinct substances: first, neurofibrils; second, perifibrillar substance.
In most nerve cells there is a third substance called chromophilic
bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>neurofibrils</i>, extremely delicate, are continuous throughout
the cell body and all of its processes. Within the body of the cell
they cross and interlace and probably anastomose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>perifibrillar substance</i> is a fluid or a semifluid substance which
both in the cell body and in the processes surrounds and separates
the neurofibrils.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>chromophilic bodies</i> are granules or groups of granules which
occur in the cytoplasm of all the larger and of many of the smaller
nerve cells.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>THE SPINAL NERVES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The first pair of spinal nerves come out between the atlas and the
occipital bone. Each nerve divides into three branches. The first
is the <i>anterior branch</i> which innervates the dorsalis, the biventer
cervicis, the cervicales, and the caput posticus muscles. The second
is the <i>recurrent ventralis</i> which passes mesially and downward
from the recurrent communicans. It innervates the rectus capitis
anticus muscle and joins a branch of the hypoglossal nerve. There
is given off a white ramus communicans to the sympathetic nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second spinal nerve emerges from the opening between the
first and the second cervical vertebræ and is similarly disposed as
the first cervical. It gives off a branch called the recurrent ventralis
which fuses with branches of the first cervical and the hypoglossal
nerve. This nerve innervates the complexus muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The succeeding cervical nerves emerge in a similar manner down
the neck and are distributed to the muscles and other structures of
the cervical region. The second, the third, and the fourth cervical
nerve gives off branches which form anastomosing loops with the
facial nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Gadow the last cervical nerve passes between the
last cervical and the first dorsal segment. There are thus fifteen
pair of cervical nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first pair of <i>dorsal nerves</i> pass out between the first two dorsal
vertebræ. The first few dorsal nerve branches innervate only the
trunk muscles. Other branches supply the skin and the other
adjacent integument. The ventral branches of the cervical nerves
often communicate with the ventral branches of the first dorsal
nerves. These branches are larger than the superior branches and
aid in the formation of the brachial plexus. Smaller inferior branches
are distributed to the scalenus and other muscles, and extend as far
posterior as the intestines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dorsal branches of the spinal nerves in the lumbo-sacral
region are very small, on account of the lack of extensive development
of the muscles of this region. The elements entering into these
nerve trunks are largely vasomotor nerves. In addition to the
upper twigs supplying the skin and the other integument of the
region, other branches descend into the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The caudal spinal nerves are not well developed and disappear
in the region of the caudal vertebræ. The dorsal branches innervate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the levator muscles, and the ventral branches the depressor
muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is thus given off, throughout the vertebral column, a pair
of nerves between each two vertebral segments, making as many
pairs of nerves for the region as there are vertebral segments of
that region.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Brachial Plexus.</b>—The brachial plexus (Fig. 73, No. 19)
arises principally from the roots of the last three cervical and the
first dorsal spinal nerves. These branches anastomose beneath the
deep face of the scapulo-humeral articulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brachial plexus divides into two distinct parts. The first
(Fig. 73, No. 20) the dorsal called the superior thoracic is distributed
to the serratus and the rhomboideus muscle. The second is the
inferior thoracic (Fig. 73, No. 21), which consists of the main plexus,
and which gives off muscular branches especially to the sterno-coracoideus
and to the main portion passing on as the nerve trunk to
the structures of the wing.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the superior thoracic plexus there are several secondary
plexuses formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>dorsalis</i> or <i>serratus plexus</i>. This plexus is located adjacent
to the anterior part of the main plexus and is formed of from two
to four spinal nerve branches. The rhomboideus is supplied by
branches which may be traced to the first root of this plexus.
This nerve is called the rhomboideus superficialis. Another nerve
is given off from the middle part of the dorsal side of the plexus
and is called the rhomboideus profundus. A third, the superficialis
serratus, is the largest of the branches. It breaks up into terminal
branches, one going to each serration, or digitation, of the serratus
muscle. Branches from the anterior portion of this plexus are distributed
to the patagii muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superior brachial plexus gives off the following nerves:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>subcoraco-scapularis</i>, which is purely a motor nerve, springs
from the anterior roots of the plexus. It gives off a branch to the
following three muscles: subcoracoideus, subcoracoido-scapularis,
and scapulo-humeralis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>scapulo-humeralis</i> is distributed to the scapular humeral
region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>latissimus dorsi</i> is located on the peripheral border of the scapulo-humeralis
or supraspinatus. It originates from the second,
and the fourth nerve roots of the plexus. It is located on the dorsal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>side of the plexus. It divides into two main branches, one going
to the latissimus dorsi and the other to the scapulo-humeralis
muscle. From the side are given off branches which supply the
patagii muscle and enter into the formation of the dorso-cutaneous
plexus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>axillaris</i> springs from the second and the third root of the
brachial plexus, extends in a lateral direction, passing the ventral
and distal rim of the insertional part of the posterior scapulo-humeralis
or teres et infraspinatus and enters near the capsular ligament
of the shoulder-joint. It gives off to this joint a small branch,
called the recurrent articularis, which passes outward between the
triceps brachialis and the humerus. It lies on the inner side of the
major deltoid, and patagii muscles, and also the skin of the lateral
shoulder and the upper arm region. The recurrent axillaris communicates
with the main branch of the radial nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>cutaneus brachii superior</i> is a small nerve which springs
from the last brachial plexus root and passes between the skin and
the triceps brachii muscle on the dorsal surface of the upper arm,
or brachial, region. It extends down over the elbow region, where
it gives off numerous branches to the skin of these regions, to the
meta-patagium and to the extensor muscles of the upper arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>brachialis longus superior</i> is a large nerve trunk which springs
from most of the other plexus roots. It extends around to the
dorsal side of the upper arm and supplies the skin, the feathers, and
the muscles of the forearm and the hand. Branches from this nerve
trunk supply the triceps brachii and other muscles of the region.
The main branch passes between the radius and the ulna, and, passing
the elbow-joint, gives off branches to that joint. Passing on, it
divides into two branches. One of these extends superficially over
the upper part of the condylus ulnaris and supplies the extensor
digitorum communis and the extensor metacarpi ulnaris, or flexor
metacarpi radialis muscles, and, continuing superficially to the
ulnar side, is distributed to the skin of the region. The second, a
deep branch, extends on the ulnar side of the radius over the extensor
indicis longus, and innervates the latter muscle, the extensor
pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis brevis, the adductor pollicis, the
interosseous palmaris, and the flexor digitorum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inferior brachial plexus gives off the following branches:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>supra-coracoideus</i>, a large nerve which springs from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>first main root of the plexus, and passes outward through the foramen
coracoideum of the sternal ligament.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>sterno-coracoideus</i>, a small nerve which extends downward
from the plexus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The somewhat large <i>posterior coraco-brachialis</i>, nerve which
springs from one or two middle roots of the plexus and accompanies
the pectoral nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>anterior thoracic</i>, a large nerve which springs from two or
three of the posterior roots of the plexus and extends to the shoulder
cavity where it branches. The anterior branch is distributed to
the patagium and the front part of the pectoral muscles. The
posterior branch supplies muscles along the side of the thorax and
extends into the abdominal muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>anterior coraco-brachialis</i>, a small nerve which springs mostly
from the inferior longus brachialis, passes to the distal end of the
tuberculum humeralis radii, then passes backward between the
front part of the humerus and the biceps, where it supplies the
anterior coraco-brachialis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>cutaneous brachialis</i> et <i>inferior brachialis</i>, a small nerve which
springs from the posterior roots of the plexus. It is distributed to
the skin of the region and branches are given off to the patagii and
the ventral wing surface. A few branches extend as far as the upper
arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>brachialis longus inferior</i> (Fig. 68, No. 2), a continuation of
the main trunk of the inferior brachial nerve, which comes out of
all the plexus roots except the first. It gives off some branches to
the pectoral region and then enters the shoulder cavity. It gives
off the anterior coraco-brachialis, passes down the humerus in an
S-shape, and divides into two branches, the ulnar and the median.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ulnar nerve</i> (Fig. 67, No. 3) divides into numerous branches
which are distributed to the ulnar side of the forearm and the hand.
The ulnar nerve passes below the skin of the ulnar outside rim of the
forearm and gives branches to the carpi ulnaris, finally supplying
the flexor digitorum; it then passes with the tendon of this muscle
downward to the interosseous dorsalis, the abductor indicis, or
flexor minimi brevis, the flexor pollicis, and the abductor pollicis,
or extensor proprius pollicis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>median nerve</i> (Fig. 67, No. 2) extends down the arm and gives
branches to the biceps muscle, and to the patagii region. Continuing,
the median nerve supplies the pronator muscle and the brachialis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>inferior, or brachialis anticus, and then divides into two branches.
The first and largest branch passes between the two pronator muscles
giving branches to the pronator profundus, or pronator longus, and
the flexor digitorum profundus muscle. This nerve then passes
anteriorly along the tendon to the base of the digit, and, on the
dorsal side, joins the other branch of the median nerve. At this
point there is often a plexus, and at the point of fusion of the ulnar
nerve on the ulnar side there may also be a small plexus. These
plexuses mainly supply the skin of these regions. The second
branch, passes forward, crosses the extensor carpi radialis and lies
just below the pronator profundus, or pronator longus, giving
branches to the skin. It passes downward on the radial side of the
ulnar and supplies the muscles of that part; it then continues
down the hand. Branches are given off to the extensor proprius
pollicis, the interosseous dorsalis, the flexor digitorum, and to the
skin between the thumb and the forefinger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>intercostal nerves</i> (Fig. 70, No. 18) are given off from the
spinal cord of the dorsal region. The superior branches are small
and supply the superior dorsal region. The inferior branches lie
one behind each rib, innervate the intercostal muscles, and give
a few twigs to the superficial thoracic muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Lumbo-sacral, or Crural, Nerve Plexus.</b>—The crural plexus
(Fig. 70, No. 35 and 36) is made up of trunks from the last two
lumbar and first four sacral spinal nerves. There are two portions
of this plexus separated by a considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior portion (Fig. 70, No. 35) consists of the lumbar
nerves and a portion of the first sacral nerves. The fusion takes
place on the bony ridge that separates the lumbar from the sacral
region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The posterior portion (Fig. 70, No. 36) consists of a part of the
first sacral and all of the three succeeding nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior nerve of this plexus is distributed to the abdominal
muscles. An anterior branch is given off to the sartorius. A large
cutaneous branch enters between the sartorius and the ilio-trochanteric
eminence, and supplies the outer and the upper surface of the
upper thigh region. Several short branches are given off from the
middle, or main, mass of the crural plexus to the ilio-trochanteric,
or gluteal, muscle. Another nerve passes over the side of the
sartorius adjacent to the femoro-tibialis, or extensor femoris,
and supplies the ilio-tibialis, or gluteus primus. The rest of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>section of the crural nerves pass in a distal direction over the inner
and front side of the cutaneous nerve and enter the ilio-femoralis,
or gluteus medius, the ambiens and the femoro-tibialis muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>furcalis nerve</i> comes out between the last two lumbo-sacral
vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>obturator nerve</i> springs from several roots. The anterior root
of this nerve comes from the main trunk of the crural plexus, and
its last root from the furcalis nerve. The obturator nerve extends
in a ventral direction from the plexus, then horizontally on the inner
surface of the abdominal cavity. It gives off twigs to the obturator
muscle and then passes through the obturator foramen. After leaving
the abdominal cavity it gives branches to the accessorius, the
obturator, and, the pubio-femoral, or adductor longus muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crural plexus gives off another large nerve trunk which extends
downward. Shortly after emerging from the plexus it gives
off a muscular branch to the ilio-femoralis, or gluteus medius
muscle. It then passes between this muscle and the shaft of the
femur, to the inner posterior surface of the thigh, and to the inner
surface of the knee. It gives off a branch to the structures of the
knee. At the knee this nerve terminates in several branches, some
of which pass to the inner surface of the tibial head, the internal
lateral ligament, the periosteum, the internal condyle, and finally
to the upper part of the head of the gastrocnemius muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main part of this nerve passes downward as the cutaneous
nerve, along the inner surface of the lower thigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ischiadic plexus</i> (Fig. 64, No. 41) has five to six roots, which
fuse into the ischiadic trunk. This main trunk extends out of the
abdominal cavity, through the ischiadic foramen, close behind the
anterior trochanter of the ilium (Fig. 65, No. 1). It gives a branch
to the external ilio-femoral or gluteus medius, and a branch to the
post-acetabular portion of the ilio-tibialis, or gluteus primus
muscle. The main trunk (Fig. 69, No. 13) passes downward to the
lower portion of the thigh. In this course there are two branches
which run parallel to the femoral artery and the femoral vein. It
gives off a small muscular branch to the accessorius, and further
down gives off a long slender branch to the outside of the knee-joint.
It gives off a lateral cutaneous branch (Fig. 66, No. 7) to
the posterior outer portion of the lower thigh. It supplies motor
fibers to the external head of the gastrocnemius muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the knee region the ischiadica divides into three parts. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>largest branch (Fig. 69, No. 14) passes with the tendon of the ilio-fibularis,
or biceps femoris muscle, through a loop, the biceps band,
and lies on the upper lateral surface of the fibula. It is covered
by the external head of the gastrocnemius muscle. It innervates
the three posterior muscles of the lower thigh, and then divides into
two branches. One, the superficialis peroneus (Fig. 69, No. 16)
passes with the profundus nerve, forming a double trunk and
occupying the tibio-fibular groove on the antero-lateral side. It
passes over the transverse ligament and the tibio-metatarsal joint,
and after sending small branches to the structures of the tibial
side of the metatarsus, it ends as a cutaneous nerve on the upper
side of the third and the fourth toe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other branch is the <i>peroneus profundus</i>, which separates from
the peroneus superficialis and passes downward in company with
the tendons, under the transverse ligament, and then along the
anterior upper surface of the metatarsus, where it innervates the
muscles of that region. It gives branches to the malleolus, to the
tendons of the third toe, and to the median part of the second toe,
and supplies the cutaneous structures of the third and the fourth toe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third branch of the <i>ischiadica</i>, a long nerve, is given off just
after the ischiadica passes through the loop. It passes downward
between the two peroneal nerves. It is covered by a sheath. It
passes over the posterior outside rim of the intertarsal joint and
innervates the tendon sheath. The main portion of this nerve is
located on the anterior surface of the tendon Achillis, and passes
down on the plantar side, and innervates the periosteum and all
plantar foot muscles. It finally radiates to the plantar surface of
the three anterior toes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The integument of the toes is sparingly supplied with nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nerve trunks that do not pass through the biceps band, or
loop can be divided into a medial (Fig. 69, No. 15) and a lateral
(Fig. 69, No. 17) portion. The medial portion (Fig. 69, No. 15)
soon divides into numerous branches which supply the muscles
of the posterior and the inner portion of the thigh. A rather large,
long branch passes downward along the tendon of the plantar muscle,
which lies on the posterior median edge of the tibia, and gives
off twigs to the median and posterior part of the intertarsal joint,
supplying the periosteum and other structures and the adjacent
skin. It passes downward along the outer side of the medial metatarsal
insertion of the tendon Achillis.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>The <i>fifth branch</i> is given off from the second trunk and lies laterally.
It is covered by the external head of the gastrocnemius,
passes along the vena saphena, and gives off a short main branch
to the inner side of the intertarsal joint. The main part passes
the tibial side of the joint, becomes subcutaneous, and finally
innervates the two plantar muscles. A lateral ascending inner
branch innervates the flexor perforatus digitorum, and, in company
with an outer branch, the external head of the gastrocnemius, and
also the flexor pedis perforatus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>plexus pedundus</i> is formed from the spinal nerves coming out
of the plexus ischiadicus. These fibers emerge caudalward and
are directed horizontally. They frequently anastomose with each
other, especially on the pubic rim and on the outside of the plexus
ischiadicus. These branches are deeply imbedded in the kidney
substance and innervate the pubio-coccygeus, or depressor coccygis
lateralis, the ilio-coccygeus, the transversalis, the sphincter, and
other muscles of this region, and the skin of the anal region.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE BRAIN</h3>

<p class='c015'><b>The Brain Coverings.</b>—The cerebro-spinal axis of birds is similar
to that of mammals. The <i>meninges of the brain</i> are three in number,
dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater. The <i>dura mater</i> is the
thickest. It is constructed of white fibrous connective tissue, and
lines the cranial cavity. Thus it serves as an internal periosteum.
It is continuous with the spinal dura mater at the foramen magnum,
and is also prolonged as a sheath of the nerves. In birds of flight
where the air-sacs and reservoirs are developed to the highest
state, Sappy finds that, “just as the medullary tissue is replaced by
air in the bones of birds, so might it be imagined that the subarachnoid
fluid is also replaced by air around the spinal cord,” and observations
justify the correctness of this statement. The dura
mater measures exactly the volume of the marrow in birds; so that
there does not exist between the fibers and the nervous surface
any space for an accumulation of liquid. This anatomical fact is
sufficient to demonstrate the absence of subarachnoid fluid in the
bird. In denying the existence of this fluid, it ought to be added
that in this class of vertebrates, the spinal prolongation is covered
by a triple envelope; and that between the pia mater and the dura
mater is a thin transparent membrane, which is lubricated by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>serous fluid. This fluid however does not collect; it only moistens
the arachnoid membrane.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>arachnoid</i> is located between the dura mater above and the
pia mater below. The pia mater adheres closely to the nerve
tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>falx cerebri</i> exists in fowls and in turkeys. It has the form of
a segment of a circle, and extends from the middle of the interval
of the openings for the olfactory nerves to the tentorium cerebelli.
The falx cerebelli is absent. The tentorium is small and is sustained
by a bony plate, and there are in addition two folds, one on each
side, that separate the hemispheres from the tubercula quadrigemina.
Owing to the absence of the falx cerebelli, the meninges lie close
together. The falx cerebri is ossified in birds.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Brain Structure.</b>—The brain (Fig. 62, <i>C</i> and Fig. 75, <i>A</i> and
<i>C</i>) is made up of three principal parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum
and the medulla oblongata. In a fowl of medium size the
brain weighs about 150 grains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pons varolii is absent in birds. The crura cerebelli (Fig.
75, No. 9) are immediately connected with the corpora restiformia.
The lower face of the isthmus is convex posteriorly; in front, the
tubercula bigemina (Fig. 75, No. 4) are united to each other by a
comparatively large transverse cord, formed by the optic nerves
intercrossing in the median line. The superior face of the medulla
oblongata is depressed above to constitute a fourth ventricle; in
front of this ventricle are the tubercula bigemina, or <i>optic lobes</i>.
These two voluminous tubercles are separated from each other above,
where they embrace the cerebellum, and are salient on the sides of
the lower face. They are hollow internally, and communicate
with the aqueduct of Sylvius. The thalami optici are not well
developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large <i>transverse fissure</i> divides the cerebrum from the cerebellum
(Fig. 75, No. 5). The optic chiasm (Fig. 75, No. 15) behind which
lies the hypophysis (Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 20) covers the region of the middle
brain. The large transverse fissure is the dividing line between the
hemispheres and the optic lobes. If the hypophysis be removed
there will be observed a slit surrounded by gray matter which is
called the tuber cinereum et infundibulum (Fig. 75, No. 18).
On the pars commissuralis and the after brain there are visible the
roots of the fifth, the ninth, the tenth, and the twelfth pairs of
cranial nerves. Close beside the median furrow which extends to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the front part of the long furrow of the spinal cord there is observed
the third pair of cranial nerves, which have their origin in the middle
brain. The fourth pair of cranial nerves extend from the roof of the
middle brain on both sides between the middle brain and the optic
lobes. These nerves finally emerge and become visible on the
ventral surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sixth nerve is visible near the middle furrow and almost in
the middle of the pyramids, and near the roots of the fifth, the
seventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the twelfth pair of cranial nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>medulla oblongata</i> (Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 1; Fig. 75, <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>) terminates
anteriorly in the pars commissuralis and the pars peduncularis.
As the spinal cord approaches the head there is a gradual swelling,
or lateral thickening, which merges into the medulla oblongata.
The superior and the inferior surface of the medulla oblongata (Fig.
75, No. <i>A</i>, 1 and <i>C</i>, 17) are flattened. There is a shallow furrow and a
slight swelling at the point where the hypoglossal nerve emerges.
The central canal of the spinal cord gradually comes closer to the
upper surface and communicates with the fourth ventricle, at which
point the posterior raphe is shortened and the sulcus longitudinalis
posterior becomes shallow. At the point where the central canal
terminates in the fourth ventricle there is a V-shaped point called
the <i>calamus scriptorius</i> (Fig. 75, No. 2). The <i>fourth ventricle</i> is
located on the upper wall of the medulla oblongata below the cerebellum,
and is bounded laterally by the peduncles of the cerebellum.
It is marked posteriorly by the calamus scriptorius and anteriorly
by the valve of <i>Vieussens</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>The <i>valve</i> of <i>Vieussens</i> is located at the posterior end of the aqueduct
of Sylvius. The posterior part of the fourth ventricle is marked
by grooves or furrows. Extending along the central part of the
floor of the fourth ventricle there is a sulcus, or groove, called the
sulcus centralis, which divides the superior pyramids. On the
median lateral sides there are two points of gray substance which
form the alæ cinereæ. The roots of the pneumogastric, the glosso-pharyngeal,
and the spinal accessory may be traced to the alæ
cineræ and the gray matter of the ridges of the medulla oblongata.
The sixth pair of the cranial nerves emerge from the medulla near
the sulcus centralis and to the side of the auditory nerve. Part
of the trigeminus emerges from the rim of the furrow next to the
ridge. At the outer border of the medulla are observed the thick
ends of the roots of the pneumogastric, the spinal accessory, the
glosso-pharyngeal, and the auditory facialis.</p>

<p class='c007'>On both sides of the sulcus longitudinalis inferior are found the
<i>inferior pyramids</i>, or <i>pyramidal columns</i>. These pyramids become
expanded near the origin of the third pair of nerves and merge into
the cerebral peduncles, or crura cerebri.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pyramidal fibers may also be traced to the optic lobes. The
roots of the abducens are found at a point between the crura cerebri
and the optic lobes. The third pair lies to the side of this, and the
roots of the trigeminus are adjacent to those of the third. A
bundle of fibers from this region pass into the cerebellum and form
the crura cerebelli; others pass into the cerebellum from the side,
spreading out in fan-shaped radiation, and forming the white central
substances peculiarly arranged, called the arbor vitæ, or <i>tree of life</i>.
A third bundle fuse with the crura cerebelli anteriorly, and pass
into the peduncles of the cerebrum, or crura cerebri.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gray ganglionic substance forms columns which extend the
whole length of the medulla oblongata and into the cerebri. The
medulla oblongata contains numerous centers which preside over
various visceral functions as deglutition, respiration, thermotactic,
secretory, cardiac, and digestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the medulla as in the spinal cord there are five main groups
of cells. First, the posterior or upper horns, from which come the
somatic sensory nerves. Second, Clark’s cells, located centrally,
which are the origin of the ganglionated splanchnic nerves. Third,
cell groups of the lateral horns which are the center for the non-ganglionated
splanchnic nerves, and certain other nerves for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>viscera, including the enteric muscles. Fourth, cell groups of the
anterior horns, which are the center of all somatic voluntary
muscles. Fifth, groups of single cells probably belonging to the
posterior horns which are probably centers for other splanchnic
nerve fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>gray matter in the cord</i> is in the form of two commas placed
with their backs together with the central canal passing between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>them. The central canal is located in the center of the cord. As
the cord nears the medulla oblongata the form of the gray matter
changes. The second, the third, and the fifth ganglion centers are
arranged laterally, and show a distinct side-horn group. The
central canal separates the two Clark’s columns; later the side-horn
group enlarges and extends ventrally around the anterior horn group
and joins on the other side in half-moon shaped formation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>central ganglionic mass of the spinal cord</i>, the center for the
enteric visceral system, is divided into three complex parts. First,
there are cell groups on both sides of the posterior raphe. Second,
the half-moon shaped ventral groups extending parallel peripherally
described above. Third, lying between groups one and two a complex
group, which possesses a large collection of cells. These furnish
splanchnic nerve centers, the anterior supplying motor nerves
and carrying motor impulses outward, and the superior sensory
which carry impulses to the centers. The cell group of the superior
horns takes a sidewise peripheral position (Gadow).</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>cerebellum</i> (Fig. 62, <i>C</i>, 2) is located above the medulla oblongata
and posterior to the cerebrum. The cerebellum consists principally
of a median lobe called the worm. The lateral lobes are
conical and rudimentary. The under part of the worm forms the
roof of the fourth ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the upper surface of the cerebellum are numerous transverse
markings (in the hen 13 or 14) which divide the lobe into leaves.
When the cerebellum is cut lengthwise there is observed on the
sectioned surface the peculiar arrangement of the white and the
gray matter, the arbor vitæ, mentioned above. There is a small
cavity in the cerebellum which communicates with the fourth
ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>cerebellar cortex</i> shows four parts, namely: First, the central
part composed of white medullated fibers, between which are
arranged neuroglear cells. Second, a rather reddish layer of cells
of different sizes. These cells are embedded in a fine ground
substance and are about 0.003 mm. in diameter. Third, a plain
layer of large pear-shaped ganglion cells, the cells of Purkinje.
Fine branches extend outward from the apex of these cells. Fourth,
an outer gray layer which consists of small multipolar nerve cells
with some neuroglear cells. The color of these three layers, according
to Gadow, depends upon the color of the plumage; that is, if
the plumage is dark, this layer is dark; if light, the layers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>light. The marked coloring is said to be most distinct in the
second layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anterior portion of the cerebellum consists of medullated
nerves whose fibers run crosswise. These are the extensions of the
true cerebellar fibers, which become fewer and fewer as they proceed
anteriorly. Finally, a few remaining fibers running crosswise fuse
as the commissura Sylvii, and extend into the lobi optici. A layer
of nerve cells extends under these medullated nerve fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bundle of fibers extending from the medulla oblongata. These
fibers extend into the optic lobes, form the crura cerebri, or
peduncles of the cerebri, and also form the inferior wall, or floor,
of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The crura are sometimes spoken of as
the partes pedunculares. These contain gray matter. The following
division is made of the ganglion of this region. First, a group of
cells near the base of the peduncles, which are divided from the
ventral rim by the arciform fibers. This ganglionic formation may
be considered an extension from the medulla oblongata. Second,
a group of the ganglion cells of the lobus optici. Third, a group
of cells lying near the lobus opticus, which give rise to the ascending
roots of the trigeminus. Fourth, a group of ganglionic cells from
which spring the roots of the motores occuli, and which lies near
the middle line and under the sulcus centralis. Many ganglion
cells are found to the right and to the left of the sulcus centralis,
which show different arrangement of the cells at different levels.
Fifth, a group of irregular cells which extends centrally on the
superior walls of the third ventricle and to the superior part of the
lobus opticus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The microscopic structure of the roof of the lobus opticus, or
corpus bigeminum, shows that the layers are arranged parallel to
the pia mater and are divided into the following parts:</p>

<p class='c007'>Externally, the pia mater.</p>

<p class='c007'>An outer layer of very fine nerve fibers, which lies just below the
pia mater.</p>

<p class='c007'>A layer of fine granular ground substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thin layer of small cells the diameter of each of which is 0.038
mm.</p>

<p class='c007'>A layer of fine granular ground substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second thin cell layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A zone of fine granular ground substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A third thin cell layer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>A fine granular ground substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fourth widely extended cell layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fine granular layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A somewhat thick layer of spindle-shaped cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>A layer of medullated nerve fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>This last is the inner layer of nerve fiber. On the inner surface
of this layer we find the ependymal cells, the cells that line the cavity
of the optic lobes. The commissura Sylvii form the covering of the
lobi optici and join these two lobes. This commissure is formed
from the upper and the lower layer of nerve fibers. In the commissure
these fibers cross each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>hypophysis</i> (Fig. 62, No. <i>C</i>, 20) lies back of the chiasm, or
optic commissure, and below the middle of the third ventricle. The
infundibulum, a pedicle-like structure, connects the hypophysis with
the third ventricle of the cerebri. It contains a cavity and forms
an extension of the third ventricle. The hypophysis is divided into
two lobes, an anterior and a posterior.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>third ventricle</i> communicates anteriorly with the lateral
ventricles of the cerebri through the foramen of Monro, and posteriorly
with the fourth ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius.
The posterior walls of the third ventricle are relatively thick and
form the posterior brain commissure. The wall is thin from the
commissure to the chiasm. Within it lie two ridges, which connect
the two hemispheres with the corpus callosum, and, farther anteriorly,
with the anterior cerebral commissure. The space from
the third ventricle and to the anterior commissure is called the
laminæ terminales.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>pineal gland</i>, located between the cerebri and the cerebellum,
lies against the choroid plexus, which covers the highest point of
the third ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>cerebrum</i> is divided by a deep longitudinal fissure into two
hemispheres. The cerebrum is shaped somewhat like the heart on
a playing card. The lower face is somewhat flattened. The upper
and lateral sides are not provided with convolutions or sulci, but
are smooth. The fissure of Sylvius is faintly marked on the inferior
face. The olfactory lobes appear well developed and are relatively
large for the size of the brain. They lie close together on the extreme
anterior portion in the median line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>olfactory cerebral crura</i> emerge from the cranium at the
upper angle between the posterior wall, the roof, and the septum of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the orbit, and pass through the olfactory foramina and in grooves
on the upper part of the septum; then passing forward they penetrate
the frontal structure and are finally distributed over the
turbinated mucous membrane.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>corpus striatum</i> is large; it occupies nearly the entire floor
of the ventricles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>anterior commissure</i> is found between the hemispheres. Its
middle part lies in the lamina terminalis on the division between
the anterior and the middle brain, and close to the thalami optici.
Its side extensions are rounded masses called the nervi amygdales.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>corpus callosum</i>, quite rudimentary, lies on the posterior
dorsal rim of the anterior commissure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>corpus striatum</i> forms a thin broad ridge, which passes ventrally.
This structure consists of twenty-five large pyramidal cells
which lie in the posterior lateral dorsal section, and of from ten to
fifteen pyramidal cells which are located in the rest of the section.
In addition to these two groups there are many cells about 5 millimeters
in diameter. These lie, six or more, in a nest imbedded in
neuroglia. There is a thin layer of spindle cells near the ventral line.
The outer nerve nest, or nerves amygdalis, lies in the posterior
lateral ventral part. It is covered by a thin membranous layer.
Its cells are pyramidal in shape and are from 10 to 15 millimeters in
diameter. The cells terminate in spindle form toward the periphery.
Nerve fibers extend from the anterior commissure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outer wall of the corpus striatum consists of the following
layers:</p>

<p class='c007'>An outer white layer consisting of fine medullated nerve fibers
imbedded in a ground substance containing numerous nerve cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>A layer of ganglionic cells, consisting of pyramidal cells from 10
to 15 millimeters in diameter, of other round cells 20 millimeters in
diameter, and finally of cells only 5 millimeters in diameter. This
layer forms a reddish line in the dorsal portion of the corpus striatum.</p>

<p class='c007'>These layers form part of the median and the posterior cerebral
wall of the lateral ventricle. The lateral ventricle is closed except
for a slit-like opening behind the posterior commissure. This is the
foramen of Monro, through which the lateral ventricle communicates
with the middle, or third, ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>choroid plexus</i> is found at the base of the lateral ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wall of the lateral ventricle becomes thinner near the region
of the transverse commissure on the surface toward the middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>brain. At this point the pia mater and the ependyma, or the lining
cells of the ventricular membrane, form the major part of the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The domestic fowl does not have the hippocampus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wall of the middle ventricle consists of an outer white layer,
which is arranged similarly to that of the corpus striatum. The
ventral rim of the wall is formed by a spiral band which consists
of fine medullated fibers, in which are imbedded a few cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>processus cerebri mammillares</i> are also called the tubercula
olfactoria. From these structures extend forward the olfactory
nerves, the posterior roots of which may be traced to the walls of
the lateral ventricles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The structure of the processus cerebri mammillaris is made up of
five layers as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>An outer layer, which consists of colorless olfactory fibers extending
in all directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>A granular ground substance layer, in which are imbedded a few
cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thicker granular layer, on the inner edge of which are twenty
large pyramidal cells with processes pointing outward.</p>

<p class='c007'>A layer of closely packed cells, in which are fine medullated nerve
fibers. These cells are about 5 millimeters in diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'>An innermost layer of ependymal cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near the hemisphere the peripheral nerve fibers and nerve cells
disappear, leaving only the ground substance of the processus to aid
in the formation of the hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a long bundle of fibers on the lower surface of the hemisphere,
which blends with the substance of the olfactory fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peduncles of the cerebrum (Fig. 62, No. 21) are the slightly
diverging columns of nerve tissue, which form the anterior continuation
of the medulla oblongata and disappear under the optic tracts
and the chiasm.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM</h3>

<p class='c015'>The sympathetic nervous system commences anteriorly at the
large superior cervical nerve ganglion. This ganglion, anteriorly,
brings into communication the glosso-pharyngeal, the pneumogastric,
or vagus, and the sympathetic system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following nerve trunks emerge from the superior cervical
nerve ganglion: a large trunk fusing with the vagus and directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>downward, accompanying and surrounding the carotid artery; a
second large trunk fusing with the recurrent pharyngeus and the
glosso-pharyngeus; a third trunk which merges with the hypoglossal;
finally several trunks which are distributed to the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>temporo-lacrimalis</i>, one of the large sympathetic nerves of
the head, as it extends from the cervical nerve ganglion, receives
branches from the ganglion radicis vagi. This nerve, passing between
these two ganglions, extends horizontally forward and outward
through a foramen, crossing the glosso-pharyngeus. Near
the Fallopian canals it crosses the facial nerves, lies supero-laterally,
and receives a short branch from the facial nerve whose fibers are
traceable to the geniculate ganglion. It also receives a branch
from the recurrent maxillaris.</p>

<p class='c007'>This nerve accompanies the external ophthalmic artery forming
around it a network of fibers, called the external ophthalmic plexus.
It lies outside and downward from the optic nerve, sends fine
branches to the external ophthalmic artery and to the masseter
artery, and extends along with a small branch of the superior
maxillary nerve to the skin of the outside rim of the eye cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ophthalmic plexus</i>, a second trunk extending to the head,
enters in its course, anteriorly, the lacrimal plexus. Its fibers also
supply the lacrimal gland, and finally anastomose with the second
recurrent branch of the trigeminus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sympathetic <i>caroticus cephalicus</i> nerve, a third trunk extending
to the head, after emerging from the large superior cervical nerve
ganglion, receives some small branches from the glosso-pharyngeal
ganglion, and then enters, in a horizontal manner, a foramen, the
canalis caroticus externus, located in the lower part of the basi-occipital
and the sphenoid bone. The anterior opening of this foramen,
or canal, is close to the posterior part of the pterygoid bone.
Inside this canal the sympathetic caroticus cephalicus receives a
small branch which extends in a straight line from the basal part of
the facial nerve. After receiving this branch, the nerve trunk, passing
to the ear drum, lies close to the petrosum and the sphenoid. It
is covered by the masseter muscle. The carotic ganglion is located
at the point of the fusion of the caroticus cephalicus with the main
trunk. At this point the caroticus cephalicus divides into two
branches. The first is the superior recurrent nerve, which lies
close to the upper surface of the alæ of the sphenoid, passes between
the obliquus externus and the orbital wall, around the eyeball,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and finally into the orbital septum and the internal muscles of
the eye. It communicates with the ophthalmic nerve and sends
twigs to the lacrimal gland, the gland of Harder, the upper eyelid,
and the nose. The orbito-nasale ganglion is located where these
nerves communicate near the nasal region. The second branch of
the sympathetic caroticus cephalicus is the inferior recurrent nerve.
This branch passes forward and dorsally from the pterygoid bone to
a point where the upper rim of the rising wings of the jaw bone meets
the sphenoid rostrum. In this course, some branches are given
off to the pharynx, one branch near the lacrimal gland, and a branch
which communicates with the superior maxillary nerve just before
the nerve enters the jaw bone. The spheno-palatine ganglion is at
the point of fusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The terminal branches of the spheno-palatine are distributed
to the hard palate, the nose, and the lacrimal gland.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the large cervical nerve ganglion and near the roots of the
caroticus cephalicus are given off a few small nerve fibers which pass
alone to the pharynx or accompany the jugular nerve branches, and
fuse with the main trunk of the caroticus cephalicus nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the large superior cervical nerve ganglion the sympathetic
trunk extends downward toward the thorax. It is covered deeply
with muscles. This portion is known as the cervical sympathetic
nerve trunk. A trunk lies on each side of the cervical vertebræ.
The large thoracic nerve ganglion, the inferior cervical, is located
along this trunk at the entrance of the thorax. From this ganglion
there is given off the recurrent cardiacus which supplies the heart.
The end branches of the sympathetic nerve trunk blend with the
pneumogastric nerve. The inferior nerve ganglion is the ganglion
cardiacum. Near this ganglion is found a nerve plexus in which
there are imbedded peripherlistic ganglia. This thoracic plexus,
accompanying the collica artery, passes to the abdominal region,
supplying the intestines and taking part in the formation of the
abdominal plexus. The abdominal plexus is located near the
anterior portion of the kidneys. Its fibers are directed mainly
downward to the visceral organs. The large intestine, the rectum
and the copulatory organs receive branches. These latter branches
take part in the formation of the pedunda nerve plexus. Some
branches of this plexus, follow the branches of the posterior mesenteric
artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>thoracic trunk</i> (Fig. 64, No. 42) of the sympathetic is double.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>The anterior portion gives off an anterior splanchnic nerve, or
plexus (Fig. 64, No. 43) which accompanies the celiac axial artery
to the gizzard and liver, communicating with the pneumogastric.
The posterior splanchnic nerve is intimately combined with the
adrenal body, and the testes, or the ovary (Fig. 64, No. 45). Intestinal
branches accompany those of the mesenteric arteries (Fig. 64,
No. 46). Other branches supply the kidneys, and communicate
with long branches of the spinal nerves destined for the cloaca and
adjacent parts, and thus form a plexus similar to that found in
mammals.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</h3>

<p class='c015'>According to function, the nerves composing the trunks are
divided into afferent and efferent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>afferent nerves</i> are those that convey the impulses from the
periphery of the body to the nerve center, which are located in the
brain or in the spinal cord. The impulses conveyed are those of
special senses, as sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. Impulses
producing sensation pleasurable or painful come from the skin, the
muscle, or the viscera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>efferent nerves</i> are those which convey impulses from the
nerve centers to the periphery. These impulses may be motor as
those going to the muscle cells of the skeletal muscles, the viscera,
or the blood-vessels. These motor impulses make movements in
these organs possible. In the blood-vessel they result in the control
of the caliber of the vessel. These impulses may be of an inhibitory
character, as in slowing the heart. They may be secretory impulses
stimulating the gland to activity or regulating metabolism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ganglia</i> are nerve centers which receive and generate impulses;
the nerve trunks are filaments which convey impulses. The
gray matter of the cord described above is the ganglionic portion,
and the outer white matter is made up of nerve fibers which convey
impulses from one part of the cord to another, or to and from the
brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nerves that have their roots in the spinal cord superiorly,
are sensory; that is, they convey the sensory impulses from the
periphery to the cord ganglion and to the brain. They have a
ganglion just outside the cord.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nerves that have their roots in the spinal cord inferiorly;
that is, they convey motor impulses from the nerve centers to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>periphery. The function of the inferior roots is to supply all the
voluntary muscles as well as the oviduct, the intestines, and other
hollow viscera, including the blood-vessels with the power of movement.
Many of these fibers pass to the sympathetic ganglion and
are distributed as sympathetic nerve fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cord is divided into different tracts, that is, certain groups
of fibers convey certain kinds of impulses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superior column of the cord conveys to the cerebrum such
impressions as temperature, pressure, and muscular tension.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fibers of the lateral columns carry sensations of pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fibers of the direct cerebellar tract carry impulses which
result in the maintenance of the equilibrium of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the voluntary impulses originate in the cerebrum, pass through
the cerebellum and travel direct to the bulb; they then pass over
to the opposite side, and travel by the crossed pyramidal tract to
the multipolar cells of the inferior horn of the spinal cord, and transmit
the impulse through motor fibers that originate at that point in
the cord.</p>

<p class='c007'>All sensory impulses enter the brain on the side opposite their
origin, and all motor impulses leave the brain on the side opposite
that to which they are distributed. Injury of the motor area of the
right side of the brain leads to paralysis of the left side of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>An impulse of the vasomotor nerve travels in the lateral column
of the cord.</p>

<p class='c007'>A nerve impulse may originate in the brain and be modified in
passing through a ganglion in the spinal cord or in the sympathetic
system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The system of <i>reflex action</i> is as follows: first, an efferent nerve
which conveys the impulse from the periphery to a nerve center;
second, a ganglion, or nerve center, to receive the impulse and generate
other impulses; third, an efferent nerve to convey the impulse
from the nerve center to the periphery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is an example of reflex action. The foot of a fowl
is pierced with a pin. The sensory impulse is conveyed by sensory
nerve fibers to the nerve centers. In this center the ganglionic
nerve cells generate a motor impulse which is sent back through the
motor nerve fiber to the muscles controlling the part. The result
is that the muscle contracts and jerks the foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many <i>functional centers</i> located in the medulla oblongata.
Destruction of this part of the system results in instant death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of the bird. In addition to furnishing a path for fibers carrying
impulses from the body to the cerebrum, it furnishes a large number
of centers for such functions as respiration, swallowing, secretion,
temperature, and vasomotor and cardiac activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>function of the cerebellum</i> is principally that of coördination.
It brings about harmony and rhythm in muscular movements. If
the cerebellum be removed, the bird can no longer walk. It has
lost, with this removal, all power to coördinate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>cerebrum</i> of the bird has no convolutions, and the gray, or
ganglionic, portion is thin, indicating low power of intelligence.
There are certain areas presiding over other functions, as motor
areas, sensory areas, and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>A careful study of the brain of the fowl shows us that the centers
presiding over sight and smell are well developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The olfactory bulbs are the centers of the sense of smell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The optic thalamus is the center of the sense of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sympathetic nerve system transmits impulses to the involuntary
muscular structure of all organs, including those of the
intestinal tract, the blood-vessels, and perhaps also the glands.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ESTHESIOLOGY</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE SENSE ORGANS</h3>

<p class='c015'>The five special senses are seeing, smelling, tasting, hearing, and
feeling.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE ORGAN OF SIGHT</h4>

<p class='c015'>The sense of sight in the bird is well developed. The eye (Fig. 26,
<i>D</i>, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>), the organ of sight, is relatively large, round laterally,
and rather flattened antero-posteriorly. It is located at the side of
the head. The eyeball is only slightly movable. The septum
interorbital separates the two eyeballs laterally. As in mammals,
the eyeball has three coats, which are from inside to outside, the
retina, the choroid, and the sclera. The <b>sclerotic coat</b> is completed
anteriorly by the cornea with which it forms a union called the
<i>corneo-scleral juncture</i>. Around the cornea the sclerotic coat contains
a ring of osseous scales varying in number from twelve to
twenty. The sclera may become ossified posteriorly, forming an
osseous sheath around the optic nerve. The <i>pecten</i> is a vascular
comb-like membrane stretching from the nervous opticus to the
crystalline lens. The choroid coat is always black. The pupil in
the hen is also black and round. The iris contains striated muscular
fibers. The <i>membrana nictitans</i>, located at the inner angle is well
developed. It is moved by two muscles (Fig. 26, No. <i>B</i>, 7, 8, 10).
The lacrimal gland and the gland of Harder are present. There is
no meibomian gland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>tears</i> are secreted by the lacrimal gland and are drained away
from the fore part of the eyeball by two small canals which extend
into a lacrimal sac. From this sac there extends a tube into the
nasal cavity called the lacrimal duct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower lid is the larger and often incloses a small cartilaginous
plate. The <i>conjunctiva</i> is a true mucous membrane which covers
the anterior portion of the eye cavity attaching to the cornea-scleral
juncture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>choroidea</b> is rich in pigment. On its inner surface lies the
dark pigment layer of the retina. The corpus ciliare, that part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the choroid coat bearing the ciliary processes, consist of numerous
folds. The ciliary muscles are arranged obliquely. Each consists
of three digitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>iris</i> is covered on the posterior side with pigment, the color
of which determines the color of the eye. The yellow pigment of
the iris has been said to be due to carotin and xanthophyll and the
black pigment to melanin. The enlarging and the contracting of
the pupil is brought about by muscles. The reduction of the
pupillary caliber is due to the sphincter pupillary muscle. It is
said by some anatomists that the muscles controlling the caliber of
the pupil in the bird furnish voluntary motion and that the capability
of accommodation of the eyes is greater in birds than in mammals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>retina</b> contains no blood-vessels; otherwise the structure is
similar to that of mammals. The crystalline lens is flattened on the
corneal side and is convex posteriorly. The lens epithelium develops
into fibers in the parts close to the equator, and are almost
perpendicular to the eye axis. The corneal portion is relatively
small.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>sclerotic coat</b> is dense and white. It is divided into three
layers. It is thin and flexible, and somewhat elastic posteriorly.
It has an internal layer of hyaline cartilage. Anteriorly its form
is maintained by the circle of osseous plates mentioned above.
These plates, interposed between the exterior and the middle layer,
are located immediately behind the cornea. The scales are thin
and of oblong quadrate shape, being elongated from before
backward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The choroid coat is a membrane loosely cellular and highly
vascular. It is impregnated by a black pigment. Opposite the
bony circle the choroid separates into two layers. The external
layer is the thinner and adheres at first firmly to the sclerotic; it
passes forward to become continuous with the iris. The inner layer
is thicker than the external. The two layers are made up of radiating
fibers which terminate anteriorly in the ciliary processes, the
ends of which are adherent to the capsule of the crystalline lens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The iris is delicate in structure. It is composed of a fine network
of interlacing fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ciliary nerves and blood-vessels run in the form of single
trunks between the choroid and the sclerotic, and terminate anteriorly
in a ring-shaped plexus for the supply of the iris and the
muscular circle of the cornea. As stated before, the pupil in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>fowl is round, but in the goose it is elongate transversely; and in
the owl, a vertical oval.</p>

<p class='c007'>The optic nerve approaching the sclerotic coat becomes altered
into a conical extremity, which enters a sheath and is directed downward
and obliquely forward. The extremity of the optic nerve in
the interior of the eye presents a white narrow streak. Branches of
the opthalmic artery enter the eye between the lamina of the retina,
along the whole extent of the oblique slit, and penetrate the fold of
the pecten upon which they form a delicate ramification.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crystalline lens is of soft texture. It is inclosed in a capsule
and is nearly round. It adheres very firmly in the depression in the
anterior part of the vitreous humor. The capsule is lodged between
two layers of hyaloidea, which as they recede from each other, leave
around its circumference the sacculated canal of Petit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cornea is of horny consistency and is transparent. Light
thus rapidly passes through it to the posterior part of the eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vitreous chamber, lying back of the crystalline lens, contains
a clear jelly-like substance.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE ORGAN OF HEARING</h4>

<p class='c015'>The ear, the organ of hearing, has in the fowl no conchal cartilage.
The <i>external auditory meatus</i>, or canal opening, is found on each
side of the head, and is usually guarded by a few stiff, short feathers.
In some kinds of birds these feathers are capable of being erected
so as to direct the waves of sound into the inner ear. The outer
entrance of the ear contains glands. This canal is short. It leads
to the drum, which is somewhat convex from the outside, and which
has a membrane forming a complete curtain stretched over the
outer part. The irregularly formed drum has connection with the
air-containing cavity of the skull, and by a thin cartilaginous canal,
the Eustachian tube, with the pharynx. The <i>auditory ossicles</i> are
represented by only a single bone, called the <i>columella</i>, which
most closely represents the stapes of mammals. This is attached
by processes of cartilage to the tympanic membrane. Owen considers
these cartilages as representing the malleus of mammals.
Huxley on the other hand considers them to represent the incus.
Originating from the processes is a small muscle which is attached
to the drum. This is by Shufeldt considered the Tensor tympani.
The drum cavity through the fenestra vestibularis and cochlearis
is connected with the labyrinth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The <b>inner ear</b> consists of a membranous labyrinth, surrounded by
a spongy bony structure—the bony labyrinth. In it are recognized
the vestibulum, the three half-circle shaped canals, and the cochlea.
The superior semicircular canal is the largest. The acoustic nerve
enters at the end of the canals near the ampullæ. The nerves are
supported in delicate vascular membranes lining the canals and
slightly projecting into the ampullæ.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <b>vestibulum</b> is a small irregular cavity which communicates
with the arcades and the cochlea, and through the fenestra vestibularis
with the drum cavity. The endolymph of the vestibulum
contains microscopic crystals of calcium carbonate. The semicircular
canals are relatively larger and thicker than in mammals.
The ampullæ in the upper and back part are separated by walls.
The cochlea is an obtuse conical tube-like structure slightly curved
at the blind extremity with the concavity directed backward. It
contains a membranous lining. At this point the cochlea is broadened
and accommodates a branch of the auditory nerve. This
nerve spreads out in fine filaments upon the surface of the tubes.
The hollow space of the cochlea is divided by a spiral partition,
making two chambers, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani.
These walls extend from the beginning of the cochlea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>tympanic cavity</b> is formed by the occipital, the basi- and alisphenoids,
the petrosal portion of the temporal bone. It represents
the stapedial canal leading to the foramen ovalis and the pneumatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>apertures by which the air from the Eustachian tube is conducted to
the precranial diploë.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE ORGAN OF SMELL</h4>

<p class='c015'>The nose is the seat of the peripheral portion of the organ of the
sense of smell. The terminals of the olfactory nerves, which receive
the impressions of odors, are broadened in the mucous membrane of
the walls of the anterior nares. There are no ethmoidal volutes, or
sieve-like structure, in birds. The nerve extends from the anterior
portion of the brain in cone-shape, finally dividing into filaments
which are distributed over the mucous surface of the turbinated
bones.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE ORGAN OF TASTE</h4>

<p class='c015'>The most important part of the organ of taste is the <i>tongue</i>.
In birds the dorsum of the tongue is covered by a thick stratum
corneum, a heavy layer of stratified squamous epithelium. The
tongue, therefore is not in birds so well adapted for the perception
of taste as it is in mammals. The lingual branch of the trigemini
is lacking in birds. This fact makes the ninth pair, or the nervi
glosso-pharyngei, the exclusive nerves of taste. There is an opinion
ventured by one anatomist that, since the first and the second branch
of the fifth pair, or trigemini, have terminal filaments in the hard
palate, they may furnish fibers for the sense of taste. There are
many taste cells on the tongue and on the dorsal palate.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE ORGAN OF TOUCH</h4>

<p class='c015'>The peripheral parts of the organ of touch in the fowl are the skin
and the feathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few birds special touch and taste perception can be supplied
by the edge and point of the beak.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the skin of birds are found numerous sensory nerve endings for
tactile sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sensory nerves, which provide the sense of touch, usually
terminate in one of two forms. The first are the Herbst’s bodies,
which in many respects are similar to the Picinian bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herbst’s <i>touch corpuscles</i> are found on all parts of the skin; they
are especially numerous in the region of the tail and of the wing. In
the wing they are particularly numerous in the region of the flight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>feathers. They occur in large numbers in the periosteum of the
anterior tibial region and in the mucous membrane of the cloaca and
of the generative organs. They are numerous in the conjunctiva
and on the surface of the tongue. They are also found in the gums
and in the beak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herbst’s corpuscle is made up of a central fiber-shaped part with
a smooth extension of the axis cylinder of its nerve (Fig. 29, <i>G</i>).
This central fiber is surrounded by a peculiar protoplasmic body.
Outside of this there is a double row of cubical cells which surround
the axial part. These are close together. Outside of these there
occurs a concentric lamellar layer, which contains cells. In the
periphery these lamellæ become more distinct and contain larger
but fewer cells. The capsule is made up of very thin layers, which
are continued into the perineural layer. Each body contains a
thin outer zone. The nerve fiber passes in a regular manner from
the axis cylinder, the myelemma, and the sheath of Schwann, and
as a delicate nerve twig is surrounded by a sheath consisting of
several perineural layers. As it enters the center of the touch corpuscle,
it loses its myeline sheath near the base of the body, and the
terminal fiber becomes flattened. Its rim is directed toward the
two rows of cubical cells, and it ends in a rounded knob.</p>

<p class='c007'>The touch corpuscles are the largest in the mucous membrane of
the cloaca and smallest in the skin. Hess has found these touch
corpuscles in the large filiform papillæ on the side of the tongue
and a few on its lower surface. They are also found in the soft skin
of the edges and inner borders of the beak.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STRUCTURE OF APPENDAGES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The <i>skin of the fowl</i> is very thin and does not contain oil glands or
sweat glands. In the fowl the oil is supplied by a tail or rump gland,
the <i>glandula uropygii</i> (Fig. 35, No. 16). This gland is round or oval
in shape, and about the size of a pea and consists of two lobes. It
is of the tubular variety with a teat, which, in most instances has two
openings. A medium septum divides the gland into two halves.
The oil secreted by the columnar epithelial cells is collected in a
body cavity located in the center of the gland; this has a duct extending
to the surface. The bird by squeezing out a quantity of this
oil into its beak oils the feathers, passing the beak over them, one
by one. The oil renders the feathers practically impervious to
water. It is necessary for the bird to give proper attention to its
plumage in order that the feathers appear in prime condition. Should
there be a disease of the oil gland, or should the bird become ill and
neglect its toilet the result is an unkempt appearance of the plumage,
the feathers becoming rather rough and more or less injured by the
weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>subcutis</i> is well developed and furnishes to the cutis great
capability for movement, which is necessary for the rising and falling
of the feathers. The corneum is very thin. Papillary bodies
are present only in a very few places, such as the region about the
eye and on the toes. Where the toes touch the ground in walking
there are large wart-like thickenings of the epithelium. In most
birds the shanks are unfeathered. The epidermis on the feathered
parts of the skin is thin, dry on the surface, and abounds in continuous
scales. The stratum corneum is very thick on the horny sheath
of the beak, on the top of the toes, on the spurs of the cock, and
on the scale plates that cover the skin on the shanks. The feathers
of birds serve the same protective purpose as hair on mammals.
In cold weather the skin muscles controlling the feather movements
contract; thus the feathers become ruffled much as we observe the
hair standing erect on horses under similar conditions. By increasing
the dead air space around the body, the radiation of heat is retarded,
and the body kept warmer. The corneum of the skin is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>usually rich in blood-vessels; however, in the domestic fowls there
is in the comb, in the wattles, and similar appendages of the head, a
thick vascular network.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>beak</i> and the <i>claws</i> are modified skin; they are true horn material.
At the base of the beak there is often formed scales, which
surround the nostrils, in whole or in part, and have a naked, or
waxy, appearance, which is known as the <i>cera</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The feathers may be considered of two chief kinds, the quill
feathers and the clothing feathers. The most rudimentary of the
latter are known as down. A <i>quill feather</i> consists of two principal
parts: the quill, or calamus, and the vane, or vexillum. The quill
is continuous with the central shaft, called the rachis, the two forming
the stem of the feather. Projecting outward from the stem on
each side are a large number of pointed and very flexible <i>barbs</i>.
These barbs are located nearly at right angles to the quill and have
extending from them at right angles smaller processes or <i>barbules</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>These barbules hook together the barbs and give the web its form.
In some feathers, as the hackle, and in the wing bar feathers of the
male of some breeds, there is a portion of the upper outer edge of the
feather not provided with barbules, which fact gives the feather its
characteristic appearance. The down feathers are loose and fluffy.
In this kind of feather the shaft is weak, and the barbs are not
provided with barbules. The barbs like the shaft may be considered
weak. These feathers give great warmth to the body. There are
fiber feathers appearing as hair-like filaments, and called <i>filo-plumæ</i>.
These are found scattered over the body; they are particularly abundant
in the region of the head and the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>At each end of the quill is a small opening, or <i>umbilicus</i>. Inside
the barrel of the feather there is <i>pulp</i>, which in young feathers is
very vascular; the vessels entering by the proximal umbilicus are
buried, along with part of the quill, in a papillated follicle of the
skin. From this follicle the feather is developed. At the base of
the shaft a secondary rudimentary quill is usually formed, which
may be represented by a mere tuft of down. On the same general
principle the smaller feathers are constructed. These cover the
body, the upper parts of the legs, and the head, while the larger
feathers and quills are confined to the wings and the tail. The
longest quill feathers are those arising from the hand, called the
<i>primaries</i>. Those arising from the forearm are called the <i>secondaries</i>.
Those that are developed from the proximal part of the arm
are called the <i>tertiaries</i>. The rudimentary pollux carries some feathers
which form the <i>alula</i>, or bastard wing. The scapularies are
feathers covering the scapula and the humerus. Covering the
bases of the larger flight feathers are wing coverts consisting of
several rows of small feathers. The quill feathers of the tail are
called the <i>rectrices</i>. The rectrices have considerable mobility; their
bases are covered by a row of tail coverts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pedal digits of the natatores are joined by a membrane,
covered with scaly skin, which forms the web foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feathers in many parts of the body are developed in rows,
there being intervals, or elongated skin areas, between these groups
of several rows, which are not provided with feather papillæ, but
which are covered over by the feathers developed in front of these
spaces. The definite feather lines, or areas, have been called
<i>pterylæ</i>. The intervening tracts devoid of feathers are called the
<i>apteria</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>The first outer covering of the bird, or baby chick, is a temporary
one consisting of fasciculi of long filaments of down. These
fasciculi on their first appearance, are enveloped in a sheath, which
soon becomes ruptured and are entirely cast off by the time the
baby chicks are ready to be taken from the nest or the incubator.</p>

Inside the feather is noted the pulp-like material.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The down fasciculi, each emerging from its small quill, are
succeeded by the feathers, which they apparently guide through the
skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Feathers do not spring from all parts of the body alike; especially
devoid of feathers are those parts where chafing and friction is
greatest, as under the wings and in the groin.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the quill there is a small opening, the <i>inferior
umbilicus</i>, into which projects a papilla of the dermis. Where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>quill emerges from the skin there is another small opening, the
<i>superior umbilicus</i>, from which springs frequently a small feather
called the <i>hyporachis</i>. The shaft, or <i>rachis</i>, has a groove extending
along that surface which lies next the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the newly formed chick the first indication of feathers is the
formation of papillæ, which is constituted by the upward growth of
the dermis, or the sensitive and vascular parts of the skin. Then
the skin immediately around the papilla sinks downward, so that
later the papilla is inclosed in a follicle of the skin. The epidermis
over the papilla is the same as over the rest of the surface. The
horny outer layer of the epidermis forms for the growing feather a
protective sheath which is cast off as the feather is formed. The
feather proper develops from the underlying germinative layer,
which as the feather develops, forms a cylinder of cells. The lower
part of the cylinder is in touch with the papilla; this later becomes
the quill (Fig. 80, No. 2). The upper part of the cylinder develops
the web portion of the feather. As soon as the feather is fully
developed the papilla, which has projected into the quill and
nourished it, is withdrawn, and the quill becomes filled with a pithlike
material forming septa, which extend in different directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once a year, usually in the late summer or in the fall, the entire
feather coat is changed. This process is called <i>molting</i>. During
this time the bird appears in a somewhat depressed condition, the
hen almost always ceases laying. Birds also molt in the spring,
to a limited extent. The male at this time takes on the so-called
breeding plumage, which is the most beautiful of the year. It has
recently been established by Rice, that the young fowl, in reaching
a stage of egg production, molts five times before the laying period
begins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <b>structure of the skin</b> of fowls is similar to that of the skin of
mammals. The skin consists of two layers the outer portion, or
<i>epidermis</i>, and the inner true skin, the <i>cutis</i>, <i>corium</i>, or <i>dermis</i>. If
we study a section of skin from the shank region of a fowl we find
the outer portion is differentiated into two distinct regions, the rete
Malpighii and the stratum corneum. The <i>stratum corneum</i> is the
outer horny layer. The cells making up this portion are fusiform,
flattened, and in regular rows. The nuclei in these layers of cells
are not pronouncedly visible, and the outline of the cells not clear
in a section such as used in our ordinary methods of study. The
corneum is a compact mass of remnant cells which have lost the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>appearance and their texture of living cells. It thus becomes
modified into scales upon the skin surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the stratum corneum and the stratum Malpighii there
is another zone which consists of the cells undergoing a transitional
stage from a cubical shape to a more flattened appearance, and
gradually becoming more granular and hyaline.</p>

<p class='c007'>The various parts of the epidermis are in close genetic relationship
to one another. The upper layer of epithelium is constantly
being desquamated. This casting off is compensated for by a
continuous upward pushing of its lower elements. Cell proliferation
occurs in the basal cells and in adjacent cellular strata of the
stratum germinativum, or stratum Malpighii, where the elements
are often seen in process of mitosis, or cell division. The young cells
are gradually pushed upward. During their course they assume the
general characteristics of the elements composing the layers through
which they pass. This process is as follows: each cell changes first
into a cell of the stratum Malpighii; then, when it commences the
formation of keratohyalin, it changes into a cell of the stratum
granulosum; later still, into a cell of the stratum lucidum; and finally
into an element of the stratum corneum, where it gradually loses
its nucleus, cornifies, and at last drops off.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mesodermic portion of the skin consists of loose, subcutaneous
connective tissue containing some fat. The amount of adipose tissue
in the subcutaneous layer is subject to great variation; there are a
few places in which there is little or no fat. The upper portion
of this layer contains a few elastic fibers, which interlace and run
in all directions. Numerous round or oval cells are found in the
upper region. The lower and middle portions of the corium are
richly supplied with blood-vessels terminating into capillaries, which
penetrate the portions bordering the epidermis. Nerves giving off
terminal branches also occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>The various <i>colors</i> of the skins of fowls are due to the distribution
of various quantities of two colors, orange-yellow and brownish-black.</p>

<p class='c007'>The yellow pigment is probably carotin and xanthophyll, two
pigments contained in association with the chlorophyll of plants,
which the bird obtains in its feed. These coloring matters were
formerly called lipochrome; but as lipochrome may be any coloring
matter of fat, it is not sufficiently definite. This yellow pigment,
when present, is diffused through all parts of the cell. When dilute,
it gives a yellow hue; when concentrated, orange. It is found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>epidermis and in the fatty masses of and beneath the corium, and is
probably identical with the yellow color of fat in other portions of
the body and in the yolk of the egg. A yellow shank, in a heavily
laying hen, soon loses a part of its pigment; this is also noted of
the coloring matter in other parts of the body. This fact indicates
that the coloring matter of the fatty part of the egg yolk is from
the same source as that of the fat. The draught of this substance
is more than normally and the reserve is being drawn upon. Feed
rich in zanthophyll and carotin cause intense yellow colored yolks,
and feeds poor in these substances cause the yolks to be a pale
yellow. Cotton seed meal contains two pigments, one a yellow
crystalline substance and the other a brownish resinous substance.
Both of these pigments are probably deposited in the egg yolk. The
eggs of some hens contain a large quantity giving a light brownish-yellow
color to the yolk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brown or black-brown pigment is carried in microscopic
pigment granules, which may be scattered through the ordinary
cells or may be confined to special pigment cells. The former are
confined to the epidermis; the latter may be found in both layers,
but infrequently in the epidermis. When granules are present in
the flattened cells of the corium, they occupy the nuclear region.
They lie in short thin lines while those of the under portion of the
Malpighian layer occur in oval groups. Where these granules occur
in the rete layer, they cluster around the nuclei. In the colored
skin there are dark pigment granules found in the corium and to a
less extent in the rete layer. Hanau has described a definite cellular
body which he found densely packed among the black-brown
granules. There is a central body which sends out branches in all
directions. In very dark skinned shanks these ramifying strands
interlace, and form a compact network, which in many cases is so
thick as to give the impression of a homogeneous mass. Here and
there occur round or oval pigmented bodies, which Hanau concluded
were the star-shaped cells with their pseudopod-like appendages
contracted. Pigment cells commonly lie around blood-vessels, clearly
indicating their course. They frequently form a compact tube, but
more often are limited to fragments which only partly enclose the
vessels. Pigment cells occur in several well-defined localities: in the
upper portion of the cutis among the closely interwoven strands of
connective tissue; in the region bordering the blood-vessels; in proximity
to nerves, in nerve endings and in surrounding fat masses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Isolated granules are frequently scattered throughout the lower section
of the corium. Barrows concludes that the lower bodies of pigment
play little or no part in the color of the external shank, as they
lie far below the opaque connective tissue. Melanin pigment granules
are always contained in the pigment cells. When found in the
Malpighian layer, the pigment cells are of an oval form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately below the epidermis in the shank skin, extends a
space less in width than the row of columnar cells, which is devoid
of pigment. The brown pigment is melanin, which in large quantities
takes on a black hue.</p>

<p class='c007'>White skin does not contain superficial pigment. Melanin has
been observed in the study of white shank skin, but it lay at considerable
depth or in quantities insufficient to be noticeable. In
some breeds of fowls, as the Mottled Houdan, there are areas in
which much melanin is irregularly deposited, which circumstance
gives the leg its mottled appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The yellow color is the result of a deposit of the yellow pigment
in the fat of the shank. This may be deposited in both layers of the
skin, or in the corium alone. When present it is diffused throughout
the entire cell as well as throughout the intercellular substance.
In young birds the Malpighian layer contains much yellow pigment.
Old hens have only small quantities in the corneum. In breeds
with normal yellow shanks old hens that have never laid eggs show
a deep orange color in both the dermis and epidermis.</p>

<p class='c007'>In blue shanked birds melanin is present only in the corium. The
black pigment is seen through the semi-transparent Malpighian
stratum, making it appear bluish instead of brown or black.</p>

<p class='c007'>The black shank color results when melanin appears in the epidermis.
Two forms of black pigment occur in the epidermis:
granules in both layers and pigment cells in the rete Malpighii.</p>

<p class='c007'>The green shank is produced where there is pigment in the epidermis
and numerous melanin pigment cells in the upper corium.
It is an optical effect due to melanin lying under the semi-transparent
yellow epidermis. There is no melanin in the epidermis.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beak the corium of the skin is represented by a thin layer
located between the <b>periosteum</b> and the stratum Malpighii.
Numerous blood-vessels pass into it, and in the soft horn-like skin,
occur sensory nerve fibers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nails originate from the epidermis, of which they are a
modification. The nails of the toes are bent downward. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>present a convex dorsal surface and are concave ventrally. The
dorsal surface consists of a horny plate, which is set in a nail matrix.
The ventral portion merges with the sides of the upper half, and,
as the lower portion is the softer and wears faster, the nail has a sharp
point and edge. The matrix is formed by a growth of the Malpighian
layer of the cutis. A fold of skin lies over its posterior part.
The epidermic cells of the dorsal, or nail, part, and the base of the
ventral part grow fast. The outer cell layer gradually becomes
horn-like.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>spurs</i> are conical with a flat base. The basal part rests upon
an enlargement of the shank bone. Soft structure is found between
the horny spur and the bone. The upper cells, like those of the nails
and of the skin, are constantly being worn or cast off, and new cells
push up from the lower layers of cells. These newly formed
flattened cells soon become cornified. The oldest formation is
found at the tip and the youngest at the base.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EMBRYOLOGY OF THE CHICK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That a new individual may be brought into existence, there
must be accomplished the union of the male element, or <i>spermatozoon</i>,
with the female element, the <i>ovum</i>. This union is called <i>fertilization</i>.
In the fowl this fertilization is accomplished at the anterior portion
of the oviduct, after the calyx has ruptured and discharged its yolk,
and before the albumen has been formed around it. The blastoderm
is found on the surface of the yolk. One spermatozoon is all
that is required; in fact, only one can be used in this union.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Spermatogenesis.</b>—The spermatozoa are formed by the seminiferous
tubules of the testis. From these cells, called the <i>spermatogonia</i>,
are formed other cells called <i>spermatocytes</i>, which in turn form the
<i>spermatids</i>, the immediate forerunners of the spermatozoa. During
the period of multiplication the spermatogonia divide repeatedly by
mitosis. Numbers of small cells are thus produced, each containing
in its nucleus the number of chromosomes typical of the somatic cell
of that fowl. In the second period the cells become larger and
spermatocytes of the first order are formed. Then comes the
period of maturation, during which two succeeding divisions rapidly
occur. The first division results in the formation of two cells exactly
alike. These are spermatocytes of the second order. They differ
from the somatic cells in that they contain only one-half the typical
number of chromosomes. The second division produces two similar
spermatids from one spermatocyte of the second order. Therefore
four spermatids exactly alike may be formed from one spermatocyte
of the first order. From these spermatids the spermatozoa are
formed (Fig. 55). The heads of the spermatozoa contain the nuclei
derived from the spermatids; the necks contain the centrosomes; and
the tail, consisting of three parts is probably formed from the protoplasm.
Three parts of the tail are as follows: first, the pars conjunctionis,
which unites the tail to the neck; second, the pars principalis,
which constitutes the main length of the tail; and, third, the pars
terminalis, which consists of an axial filament which transverses the
entire tail and is surrounded by a protoplasmic sheath.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><b>Oögenesis.</b>—The ovum during its formation passes through three
stages.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first stage, that of <i>division</i>, takes place before the chick is
hatched, and, according to Bradley, comes to an end about the time
of hatching. This stage consists of the rapid formation of ova in
the female chick. In the second stage, which begins about the time
of hatching, there is an increase in the size of the units of the ovary,
accompanied by <i>yolk formation</i>. At this time each ovum is in its
own follicle (Fig. 81), and is surrounded by a layer of cuboidal
cells and a <i>theca</i>. The theca is formed from the adjacent fibrous
stroma. The third stage, that of <i>maturation</i>, commences during the
development of the yolk and is complete after it has escaped to the
oviduct. Maturation consists of each cell’s dividing into two unequal
parts. In each division the cell is split into a small cell known
as the <i>polar body</i>, which is cast off and disappears, and a larger cell,
which is the ovum proper. In this process half of the original
chromosomes are cast off.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Fertilization.</b>—The sperm travels rapidly; experiments have shown
eggs to be fertile laid twenty-four hours after service by a male.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>When the ovum is discharged into the ovarian pocket it is surrounded
by spermatozoa.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the male pronucleus has united with the female pronucleus
in the single-celled ovum, there is a cleavage of the cell in the
long axis of the egg, making two cells; and then a cleavage at right
angles, which progressively continues, makes the mulberry-like
mass. The remaining content of the egg consists of food for the
development of the embryo. From this mass of cells before the egg
is laid the <i>blastoderm</i> is formed. The cells of the blastoderm are
differentiated into two layers. The superficial layer is the <i>ectoderm</i>
and the lower layer is the <i>entoderm</i>. In the newly laid egg the blastoderm
may be observed. It is about 4 millimeters in diameter.
It has a transparent central area, the zona pellucida, which is located
over the subgerminal region. There is a peripheral, less transparent
area called the zona opaca.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fertile egg, as soon as it is subjected to the proper temperature,
cell multiplication in the blastoderm begins. The first signs
of such change are noted in the pellucid area of the blastoderm
where embryonal traces appear in the form of the parallel lines
called the <i>plicæ primitivæ</i>, which diverge to form the cephalic
dilatation. At about this time takes place the formation of the
<i>myelencephalous columns</i>, in which the blood lakes expand in the
surrounding halones and in the tracts along which pass colorless
blood particles. These tracts extend from below the cephalic
expansion to the peripheral sinuses, as the <i>proto-vertebræ</i>, which
begin to appear at the sides of the myelon. The red color is acquired
by the blood, and the heart by its movements, is made more
manifest as the <i>punctum saliens</i>. A distinct membrane, the serous
layer, is formed upon the germ and the blastoderm. The cephalic
end of the embryo rises from the surface of the blastoderm, and then,
curving down, sinks into it, forming for itself a kind of hood of the
serous layer. This hood gradually extends from the margin of the
fossa over the body, and, meeting a similar fold formed by the
projecting and incurved tail, closes over the germ on the upper side,
making a circumscribed cavity, which is the <i>amnion</i>. The progress
of differentiation of layers of the blastoderm has, meantime, gone on
beneath. The serous layer is in part reflected from the vascular
and from the mucous layer. The mucous layer is concerned in the
formation of the intestinal canal; and beyond this part, which is at
first an open groove, the mucous layer expands over the yolk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>which it ultimately incloses, the margins of the <i>vitellicle</i> so formed
contracting and uniting at the side opposite the embryo at a sort of
cicatrix, to which the last part of the abdominal yolk adheres. The
vitellicle is richly vascular, and the surface next to the yolk is augmented
by rugæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fowl’s egg, at about the fortieth hour, shows the buds from
which the limbs are developed. A vesicle is seen to protrude near
the anal end of the intestine, which, rapidly expanding, spreads over
the embryo, acquiring a close adhesion to the amnion, but remaining
distinct from the vitellicle, over which it spreads. It finally encloses
the albumen and interposes itself between the latter and the
lining membrane of the shell. Umbilical vessels are associated with
this membrane. Hunter called this membrane the <i>allantois</i> from
its containing urine, and Owen states that the sac which surrounds
the albumen acts as the chorion or <i>placenta</i>; for it is most probable
that from this surface the albumen is absorbed and the chick supported
on its developmental food. The external part of the sac
apparently acts as lungs as it comes into contact with the shell of
the egg through pores of which there is an exchange of air. Oxygen
is consumed and carbon dioxide is given off. The blood in the
vessels of this membrane is in color more like arterial blood and that
in the interior more like venous blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The embryonic mass of the incubating egg always floats to the top
side. As the embryo grows it turns upon its left side, exhibiting a
profile view; it then indents the yolk, and finally almost divides it
into two parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peripheral layers of cells rise from the margin of the germ
mass, and extend and contract toward the opposite pole. This
tract of germ substance is the <i>primitive streak</i>. Along the median
line it next forms a furrow, which stops short of the ends of the streak.
This streak terminates opposite the point from which the germ
begins, and swells into the head. The median furrow expands upon
it. The cephalic borders are next united by a thin layer of epithelial
cells above the furrow, converting it into a cavity, or ventricle. The
myelonal furrow is similarly covered by a layer, uniting the lateral
columns. The embryonal trace becomes longer, narrower, and
bends round the vitellus. A layer of epithelial cells forms a network
over the whole dorsal surface of the embryo. Oblique striæ
appear in the broadening germ mass radiating from the primitive
streak. These indicate divisional segments. These beginnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>of aponeurotic septa probably accompany and support nervous
productions from the myelon columns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two transverse constrictions begin to divide the cephalic enlargements
into three lobes, the second and the third of which expand
into vesicles. An accumulation of cells at the side of the
middle expansion appears to add greatly to its breadth. This
forms the basis of the eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The differentiation and the confluence of the cell constituents
of the primitive streak have led to the formation of a pair of albuminous
cords along the sides of the median furrow, forming the
<i>myelon</i> proper. The cells exterior to and above them are converted
into muscle and fibrous septa; and beneath the column is a jelly-filled
cylinder, with a transversely striated sheath, pointed at both
ends, forming the <i>notocord</i>. Its anterior point passes a little in
advance of the acoustic vesicle. Beneath the notocord and surrounding
the blastema is stretched the vegetative, or mucous, layer
of cells, in contact with the yolk. Both the head and the tail
of the now cylindrical embryo are liberated from the surface of the
yolk. A fold of the blastema, reflected from the under part of the
head, sinks like a pouch into the yolk, and soon includes the rudiment
of the heart, like a bent cord, which begins to oscillate about
the seventh day. From the midline of the inferior surface of the
embryo, or its mucous layer, two longitudinal plates descend, diverging
into the yolk-substance, and form the <i>primitive intestinal</i> groove.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ophthalmic vesicle</i> elongates and curves outward until the
two ends almost come into contact. Between these two ends and
beneath the delicate tegumentary layer connecting them the <i>crystalline
lens</i> is formed. About the same time, the <i>otoliths</i> appear in
the acoustic vesicles, which have now acquired a cartilaginous case.
The <i>cerebral lobes</i> begin to be formed by a small fold, rising laterally
and overlapping the forepart of the second enlargement, which
has expanded to greater breadth. The <i>olfactory cavities</i> appear as
small cutaneous follicles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two myelonal columns, expanding between the ear sacs and
receding so as to show the notocord beneath, bend upward and
inward, and unite, to be continued into the posterior of the <i>optic
lobes</i>, thus commencing the cerebellar bridge across the epencephalic
ventricle. The encephalic vacuities have begun to be filled by the
granular basis of the cerebellar substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>intestinal groove</i> begins to be converted into a canal at its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>two ends. Beneath the anterior end, and behind the heart, there
gradually accumulates the cellular basis of the liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commencement of the development of the <i>organ of hearing</i>
is by a superficial depression of the cephalic blastema to meet the
process from the encephalon, which forms the acoustic nerve.
The lining of the depression becomes, on closure of the slit, the
proper tunic of the labyrinth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vesicle of the labyrinth swells into four dilatations, of which
three are ampullar and the fourth cochlear. The <i>ampullar dilatations</i>
extend into very slender canals, at first almost in the same
plane, by which they are brought into mutual communication.
As the canals expand and elongate, they assume their characteristic
relative positions as external, superior, and posterior, the posterior
end of the external canal being extended beneath the posterior
canal. The cochlear dilatation curves as it elongates. An inner
layer becomes distinct from the common membrane and forms the
<i>acoustic lamina</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the development of the ear, so in the development of the
eye, the production of the nerve process from the cerebral center
is the first step; the infolding of the superficial blastema to meet
the nerve is the next. The so-called <i>cutaneous follicle</i> becomes a
circumscribed sac or vesicle, in which the changes and the development
next proceed, converting the vesicle into an acoustic labyrinth
or into an eyeball. In each case neural elements of two vertebræ
become modified to lodge and to protect the sense organs, forming
respectively the recess called <i>otocrane</i> and that called the <i>orbit</i>.
The one is located between the occipital and the parietal vertebræ,
and the other between the frontal and the nasal vertebræ. The
part of the outer blastemal layer of the head which sinks to meet
the process from the mesencephalic dilatation, rapidly changes its
follicular into a vesicular state. The vesicle thus formed elongates,
bending around the cell mass in which the <i>crystalline lens</i> is formed,
and the meeting of the two ends results in forming the choroid
fissure at the lower part of the eyeball.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>mesencephalic process</i>, or optic nerve, expands at the posterior
of the circular sac, and, in the course of mutation into eyeball,
lines its posterior part with a layer which becomes the <i>retina</i>. The
transparent layer covering the forepart of that sac and the inclosed
lens is formed into the <i>cornea</i>. Other layers of the sac are formed
into the <i>choroid</i>, the <i>ciliary processes</i>, the <i>iris</i>, and the <i>pecten</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Of the appendages of the eye the membrana nictitans is the first
to develop. Then develop the lower lid and, last, the upper lid.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the development of the essential organs of sense, the skin
is developed. Modifications of the skin form the outer ear and the
eyelids. Then are formed the maxillary arch, the hyoidean
arch, and the scapular arch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vessels which return the blood from the vitellicle are the
transverse and the longitudinal <i>vitelline veins</i>. The first are so
called because these trunks pass to the embryo at right angles to its
axis. They are the largest returning canals. The <i>longitudinal veins</i>
extend parallel with the axis of the embryo; they are of smaller size.
The right anterior longitudinal vein becomes the right precaval and
receives the remains of the right transverse vitelline vein, as the
right vena azygos. The left anterior longitudinal vitelline vein is
also persistent as the left precaval, and enters in the mature bird,
as in the embryo, at the posterior or the lower part of the auricle.
The left transverse vitelline vein is also subsequently reduced, by
receiving only the vertebral veins of that side, to the condition of a
so-called azygos vein. The main trunk of the post-caval is the result
of the returning vessels from the abdominal viscera and the posterior
limbs at a later stage of development. There is but one principal
posterior longitudinal vitelline vein, and this anastomoses with the
left transverse vein as it enters the embryo.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>auricle</i>, which, by its dilatation of the left side, appears to be
double, receives the venous blood at its right division. The left
one, subsequently receives the veins from the lungs, is ultimately
separated from the left precaval and the right auricle to which that
vein is conducted and restricted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>ventricular part of the heart</i>, at the second day of incubation,
is in the form of a bent tube, curving from behind downward, forward,
to the right and upward, continuing insensibly into the part
representing the aortic bulb, in which the septum first appears, and
ultimately dividing the ventricle into two.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this stage the piers of the <i>maxillary arch</i> appear as buds
from beneath the eyeballs. The naso-premaxillary process is above
their interspace. The piers of the mandibular arch and those of
the hyoidean arch follow in close succession. The blastemal base
of the scapular arch projects slightly at the sides of the fovea
cardiaca; the piers, now separate, ultimately meet in front of the
heart, and accompany it in its retrograde course. The mesencephalon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>is the largest of the segments of the brain which are connected
with the eyeballs.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the heart has assumed its form as such, distinct from the
great trunks rising from it, the two <i>arteries</i> from the base of the
ventricles appear. The artery to the right bifurcates, one division
supplying the head and the wings, the other winding over the right
bronchus. That to the left also bifurcates. Its left division arching
over the left bronchus and anastomosing with the right arch a little
below and behind the apex of the heart. Its right division arches
over the back of the heart, bending to the right and anastomosing
with the right aortic arch just above the outer ductus arteriosus.
Each of these divisions of the left primary arterial trunks sends off
a branch to its corresponding lung. As the lung expands, and
especially at the beginning of the act of expansion toward the close
of the period of incubation, the blood is diverted into the pulmonary
vessels, and the channels below them shrink and disappear. The
left primary artery is retained as the trunk of the pulmonaries, and,
through the changes in the interior of the ventricle, this artery comes
to discharge exclusively the ventricle corresponding to the right in
mammals. The retained aorta rises from the left ventricle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>air-sacs</i> begin at the lower point of the lung, appearing like
small hydatids, and extend further and further into the abdomen,
in front of the kidneys. They are at first full of fluid. Soon after
the development of the abdominal air-sacs others are developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>lungs</i> are at first free, but afterward begin to be attached to
the ribs and to the spine.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the female embryo we first observe two <i>oviducts</i>, one on each
side of the basis, or stroma of the ovarium, which appears in a
relation to the primordial kidneys similar to that of the testes in the
male. At the period when the permanent kidneys have sent their
ureters to the cloaca, the oviducts have been developed as prolongations
from that part, and, up to a certain point of development, they
are of equal size and length. Subsequently the left oviduct alone
continues to grow; the right remaining stationary or shrivels;
occasionally it may be discerned as a rudimentary in the mature
bird, but usually all trace of it has disappeared before hatching.
The left oviduct expands above or at its free end into the infundibular
orifice, where its parietes are very thin. As it descends, these increase
in thickness, and the efferent tube gradually acquires the
texture and form of an intestine. It is attached and supported by a
duplicature of the peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>At first, the right and the left ovaria are similar in size, but the
symmetry is soon disturbed by concentration of development in the
left ovary. The right ovary remains stationary and ultimately,
in most birds, completely disappears by the time the chick is ready
to emerge from the shell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three fetal membranes are developed, the <i>chorion</i>, the <i>amnion</i>,
and the <i>allantois</i>. There is also developed the <i>yolk sac</i> (Figs. 82 and
83). The amnion is connected to the body wall at the umbilicus.
The amniotic fluid is found in this sac. The chorion is at first
surrounded by the albumen, but as the albumen is absorbed the
chorion comes in contact with the inner shell membrane. It is
probable that the chorion consists of ectoderm on the outside and of
mesoblast on the inside. The amnion, on the other hand, is formed
of mesoblast on the outside and ectoderm on the inner, or embryonal,
side. The allantois springs from the embryo soon after the fourth
day, and develops from the ventral wall of the primitive gut. By
some embryologists, the yolk sac is included in the embryonic membranes.
It commences as the splanchno-pleure surrounding the
mass of yolk. It becomes smaller as the yolk is absorbed. At first
its outline is round but later its walls become folded in. The yolk is
dissolved and absorbed by the entodermic lining of the sac, and is
carried to the embryo by veins called the vitelline veins (Fig. 83, No.
<i>B</i>, 4), which ramify on the walls of the sac.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some time after the fourteenth day, the chick assumes a position
lengthwise within the egg shell so that the head is near the broad
end of the egg. The head is bent upon the chest and the beak is
usually tucked under the wing. Later the head assumes a position,
by a double curve of the neck, so that the beak is in contact with the
air cell. About the fifteenth day, the coils of intestine, which
heretofore have been outside the abdominal cavity, are withdrawn
into the abdominal cavity, as is also the abdominal yolk sac. As the
chick pips out of the shell, the umbilicus becomes occluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outer upper part of the tip of the beak is provided with a
short, stout, spike-like arrangement, called the <i>egg tooth</i>. On the
twentieth day this part of the beak is forced against the wall of the
egg and gradually breaks through the egg shell. The breathing by
the lungs commences some time before hatching; this is evidenced by
the chick within the shell giving chirping sounds.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>circulation of the blood</i> is somewhat like the circulation in the
fetus of quadrupeds. The primitive tubular heart (Fig. 83, No. <i>D</i>,
8) is bent in S-shape; the two ends are connected with blood-vessels;
and later, by the development of the septa, the cavities of the adult
heart are defined. The foramen ovale is found in the median
septum. This opening brings the right and the left side into communication.
The septa between the cavities of the heart are completed
by the end of the sixth day. The two vitelline, or omphalo-mesenteric,
veins carry the blood containing the nutrients from the yolk
sac to the liver, where it is mixed with the blood drained from the
intestines by the portal vein, and this blood is finally carried by
the posterior vena cava into the right auricle of the heart. From
here it passes through the foramen ovale to the left auricle; from the
left auricle it enters the left ventricle, from which it is forced into
the aorta, and then out into the systemic circulation. Practically
all, if not all, of the blood of the pulmonary artery is sent into
the aorta through a connection with this vessel called the ductus
arteriosus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Down</i> appears about the thirteenth day of incubation. There are
two kinds of down on the chick, one long, which comes first, about
two or three days before hatching; a second, or fine, down forms at
the roots of the other. As the embryo develops the air cell, at the
large end of the egg which is developed between the two shell
membranes, or <i>membranæ putaminæ</i>, gradually enlarges.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>OUTLINE FOR LABORATORY STUDY OF THE CHICK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The objects of laboratory study of the embryos are as follows:</p>

<p class='c022'>1. To study the living embryo.</p>

<p class='c022'>2. To study the entire embryo:</p>

<p class='c023'>With the dissecting microscope, as an opaque object.</p>

<p class='c023'>With the compound microscope after killing, hardening, clarifying,
and mounting.</p>

<p class='c022'>3. To study embryos by dissection, in later stages.</p>

<p class='c022'>4. To study the serial sections with the compound microscope.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE LIVING EMBRYO</h3>

<p class='c015'>The egg is opened under warm physiological salt solution: 0.8
per cent. sodium chlorid in distilled water heated to a temperature
of 38°C.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gradually pick away the shell at the large end. Note that there
are two membranes and an air cell. Strip off the membranes.
When sufficient shell and membranes have been removed from the
large end, invert the open end of the egg in the salt solution and
allow the contents to flow out. Care must be taken not to break the
yolk. The embryo, or blastoderm, lies upon the surface of the
yolk, which is usually turned with this body uppermost. Separate
the blastoderm by cutting around the outside of the area vasculosa.
In doing this a small pair of slightly curved scissors is needed. After
the embryo, or blastoderm, has been separated, gently float it into
a watch crystal with the flat bottom submerged in the salt solution.
The watch crystal with its contents may now be gently lifted out.
Next remove the vitelline membrane. The vitelline membrane is
the delicate transparent membrane covering the blastoderm, The
embryo is now ready for study.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE PREPARATION FOR STUDY OF ENTIRE EMBRYOS AND SECTIONS</h3>

<p class='c015'>The following processes may be used in killing embryos up to
four days, or ninety-six hours, of age. After removing the embryo
as described above, spread the blastoderm out in the watch crystal
and pipette off the salt solution. Allow it to stand till the edge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the tissue begin slightly to adhere. Then slowly add the killing
fluid by aid of a pipette, dropping it on the center of the embryo.
The pipette must be held low or the mechanical interference will
dislocate the parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Older embryos are submerged with their membranes intact into
the killing fluid. The quantity of fluid should be several times the
bulk of the specimen. Kleinenberg’s picrosulphuric acid may be
used as a killing fluid. This fluid is a saturated solution of picric
acid plus 2 per cent. sulphuric acid, to which is added twice its
volume of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chick embryos from one to two days old should be left in this
fluid from one and one-half to six hours. Embryos from two to
four days old two and one-half to six hours. Remove the specimen
from the killing fluid, and place it in 70 per cent. alcohol. Change
the alcohol every twenty-four hours until the color ceases to come
out of the embryo. Preserve in 80 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the specimen is to be mounted whole, transfer it from 80 per
cent., then to 50 per cent., then to 35 per cent., and, finally to
water. Small embryos should remain in each fluid thirty minutes
and large ones sixty minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following method may be used for <i>staining embryos</i>: Dilute
Delafield’s hematoxylin with four times its volume of water. To
every 6 cubic centimeters of this diluted hematoxylin, add one drop
of Kleinenberg’s undiluted picrosulphuric acid, and leave specimen in
the fluid thus prepared until it is stained through. This will require
from one to three hours. Now pass up through the series of alcohols
to 70 per cent. Next extract the excessive stain with 1 per cent.
hydrochloric acid in 70 per cent. alcohol. Wash repeatedly with
70 per cent. alcohol to free from the acid; then transfer the specimen
to 80 per cent. alcohol and leave in this for several hours for complete
removal of the acid; then transfer to 95 per cent. alcohol for
thirty minutes. Allow the specimen to remain in absolute alcohol
for one hour. Introduce a layer of oil of cloves or xylol beneath the
alcohol. This may be done by gradually allowing the fluid to run
down the side of the bottle. After the embryos have sunk into the
oil and begun to appear transparent, remove the fluid and add fresh
oil. After the specimen is sufficiently transparent, mount in
balsam, supporting the cover slip so that it will not rest on the
embryo.</p>

<p class='c007'>In staining for section, place the embryo in borax carmine from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the 50 per cent. alcohol and leave twelve hours. Then wash in 50
per cent. alcohol; after which transfer to 70 per cent. alcohol for six
hours. Clarify in oil of cedar or oil of cloves, and place in melted
paraffin for two hours. Imbed in paraffin, and section.</p>

<p class='c007'>Embryos may be hardened, imbedded, and sectioned after the
usual methods, using either paraffin or celloidin, and the sections
stained with hematoxylin and eosin after sectioning.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN THE STUDY</h3>

<p class='c015'>1. <span class='sc'>The embryo twenty-nine to thirty-four hours old with
from ten to fourteen somites.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>A study of the egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>In opening the egg, observe that the shell membranes are double.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observe that the shell is porous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note the air cell at the large end of the egg and note that the space
or cell lies between the outer and the inner shell membrane.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the egg contents have dropped into the salt solution, note
extending from the ends of the yolk the twisted denser cords of
albumen. These are the chalazæ, which act as stays to the yolk.
Note that the yolk is surrounded by a delicate membrane. This
is the vitelline membrane. The yolk is the true ovum and serves
as food for the developing embryo.</p>

<p class='c007'>A study of the living embryo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note the amount of yolk that is covered by the blastoderm.
Note the slipper-shaped, transparent center of the blastoderm.
This is the area pellucida. In the center of this there is a narrow
white streak. The area opaca is the area lying external to the area
pellucida. In this there is the area vasculosa.</p>

<p class='c007'>A study of the embryo entire, including the vascular area.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blood islands show as irregular deeply stained masses in the
vascular area. At this stage they are inclosed in wide anastomosing
tubes, the extra-embryonic blood-vessels, which open peripherally
into the bounding sinus terminalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following structures may be identified:</p>

<p class='c007'>The neural tube forming the axis of the embryo. In the anterior
region may be noted the forebrain, the optic vesicles, the midbrain.
The hindbrain is subdivided into the neuromeres. The cord, or
myelon, of the neural tube back of the hindbrain is closed in front
but is open behind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>The head projects above the blastoderm. The fold which unites
the ventral surface of the head with the blastoderm is called the
head fold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diverging folds of the myelon encloses the primitive streak.</p>

<p class='c007'>On each side of the neural tube are the mesoblastic somites. The
series is continued behind by the undivided segmental plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heart is beneath the hindbrain. The portion of the body
cavity in which it lies, is bounded in front by the head fold and behind
by the diverging limbs of the splanchno-pleure. Its posterior or
venous end receives the vitelline veins from the vascular area. The
anterior or arterial end is prolonged into the ventral aorta.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note that the axis is somewhat bent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head fold of the amnion is noted to extend over the anterior
end of the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>A study of the transverse sections.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sections about 20 micro-millimeters thick should be cut serially,
and so mounted. Knowing how many micro-millimeters the
embryo is in length will enable one to make a diagram of the fetal
structure in the study of the series of transverse sections. The
sections should be drawn in the order studied so as to obtain relative
structural ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the microscope study the following regions:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Optic vesicle.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Midbrain.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Posterior half of the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Myelon in the closed region.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Myelon in the open region.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Through the primitive streak.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span class='sc'>The embryo twenty to twenty-four hours old with from
two to six somites.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Compare the parts in this embryo with those of the embryos from
twenty-nine to thirty-four hours old. Note and describe the relations
of the embryo, the area pellucida, and the area opaca. Note
how much of the yolk the blastoderm covers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In studying the entire embryos, note the condition of the medullary
plate. Observe if the tube is formed in any part; how far back
the head plate extends, if the heart can be seen; and if the primitive
streak is longer or shorter than in 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>Study relations of structures and make drawings through the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>of divergence of the walls of the fore gut; also through the somatic
region, and through the primitive streak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Study all parts, as the head fold, the heart, and the fore gut.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>The embryo forty-four to forty-eight hours old with
twenty-four to twenty-nine somites.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Remove the embryo with the entire area, and preserve it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note and carefully describe the changes visible to the naked eye
since the thirty-fourth hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>In making a study of the entire embryo we note there has been a
rapid growth of the dorsal surface of the head, which has become
more bent. This bend, in the region of the midbrain is called the
cephalic flexure. The forebrain and part of the midbrain form
almost a right angle with the rest of the head. The head is compressed
laterally and free from the blastoderm. The dorsal side
of the trunk is turned up, and there is a twisting of the axis of the
embryo just back of the heart. The tail fold begins at about this
time and may or may not be visible. The optic vesicles are relatively
smaller in relation to the brain than in 1. Note the part
of the forebrain to which they are attached. Observe the inner and
outer layers of the retina, the lens, the choroid fissure, and the
cavity of the vitreous humor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note the auditory vesicles and whether or not they are closed sacs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note that the heart has grown in length and has become doubled
on itself. The two ends are fixed. Note the relation of the heart
to the afferent and efferent blood-vessels. Note that two, and
possibly three, visceral pounches are visible. Note whether or not
they are ventral to the midbrain. The first, the hyomandibular
pouch, is bounded in front by the first visceral, or mandibular, and
behind by the second visceral, arch. The second pouch is bound in
front by the hyoid, and behind by the third visceral arch. The
third pouch is bounded in front by the third visceral arch, and
behind by the fourth. Note the number of mesoblastic somites and
the condition of the mesoblastic segmental plates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note how far back the foregut is closed. Locate the head fold of
the amnion, and note how far back it is closed. Note changes that
have taken place in the vascular area. In studying the sections it
will be found that a section cut transversely to the trunk will pass
horizontally through the forebrain and through the midbrain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Study a section through the trunk a short distance behind the
heart. Observe the elevation of the axis of the body. Note the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>way in which the lateral folds, or the lateral limiting sulci, in the
somatopleure, delimit the embryonic from the extra-embryonic area.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note the appearance of the mesenchyme, the approximation of
the two dorsal aortæ, the appearance of the amniotic folds. Observe
in the mesoderm the posterior cardiac veins, and the myotomes,
or muscle plates. The sclerotome is made up of the mass of
mesenchyme between the myotome, on the one hand, and the
neural tube and the notochord, on the other. Note the folding
of the splanchno-pleure, and note if there is present the Wolffian
duct, or the nephrotome.</p>

<p class='c007'>Study sections through the optic vesicles. Note if there is the
beginning of the lens. Do you note the diverticula of the pharynx?
Can you identify the closed amnion and the chorion?</p>

<p class='c007'>Study sections through the auditory pit. Note fusion of the gill
pouches with the ectoderm. Note the blood-vessels. Study sections
through the region of the heart, through the roots of the vitelline
veins, and through the primitive streak, if it is still present.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this study it will appear that the anterior end has developed
in advance of the posterior end. The tail fold has probably just
begun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Write a description of the pharynx, and of the circulation at this
stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <span class='sc'>The embryo sixty-eight to seventy-two hours old with
cervical flexures formed.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of the living embryo note the changes visible to the
naked eye since forty-eight hours old. Note the difference in the
blood-vessels of the vascular area. Name the arteries and veins.
Note the beating of the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of the entire mount note that a second, the cervical
flexure, has appeared in the head. Note that the tail fold is well
formed. Note the position of the embryo on the blastoderm. Determine
if the amnion is completely closed. Note the olfactory
pits on the ventral surface of the head, a short distance in front of the
optic stalks. Note the telencephalon, a rudiment of the cerebral
hemispheres and an extension of the primary forebrain. It is
bilobed anteriorly. The optic stalks are attached to the floor near
the anterior end of the thalamencephalon. Note the infundibular
region, which is the depressed region behind the optic stalks. In
the roof of the thalamencephalon there is a short diverticulum, the
epiphysis. The mesencephalon, or midbrain, forms the apex of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the cranial flexure, and is united to the hindbrain by a narrow
isthmus. The metencephalon, or rudimentary cerebellum, appears
as a thick portion on the most anterior division of the hindbrain.
The rest of the hindbrain is provided with a transparent roof and
constitutes the myelencephalon, or the rudimentary medulla oblongata.
Observe the inner and the outer wall of the optic cup, the
lens, the choroid fissure, and the posterior, or vitreous, chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>Note the form of the otocyst, or auditory sac. Note above which
visceral arch it lies. Note the number of visceral clefts. The
visceral arches are formed by the thickening of the walls of the
bounding clefts. The visceral arches are as follows: the first is
the mandibular, or hyomandibular, arch, which is in front of the
first cleft. From this there is developed the lower jaw. Note if
there is a maxillary process arising from the dorsal angle of the
arch. The second arch is the hyoid arch, which is located behind
the first cleft. Then follow in order the third, the fourth, and the
fifth visceral arches. Note above the mandibular arch the rudimentary
trigeminal ganglion, and above the hyoid arch the rudimentary
acoustico-facialis. The latter is in contact with the anterior
walls of the auditory sac. The rudimentary glosso-pharyngeal
ganglion is noted above the third visceral arch. The vagus, or
pneumogastric, ganglion is located above the fourth and the fifth.
Note the form and the position of the heart. Note the anterior and
the posterior limb rudiment in the trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of the sections it is found that cuts transverse to the
trunk pass about horizontally through the forebrain. At this age
the following sections of the embryo should be studied:</p>

<p class='c007'>First, through the hindbrain, at which level will be noted the
auditory sacs, the neuromeres, the trigeminal, the acoustico-facialis,
and the glosso-pharyngeal and the vagus ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, through the upper part of the pharynx, at which level
will be observed the midbrain, the hindbrain, the visceral pouches,
the nerves, and the blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third, through the choroid fissure of the optic cups. Note the
parts of the eye, and, on the other side of the section, the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth, a study of a section through the olfactory pits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifth, a study of a section through the pancreatic and the hepatic
diverticula.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixth, a study at the beginning of the allantois through the hind-gut.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>At this age it is of interest to study the systems of organs. Observe
the manner in which the splanchno-pleure folds to form the
walls of the intestine. Note the commencement of the mesentery.
Note that the foremost part of the alimentary tract is formed from the
stomodeal invagination of the ectoderm. The hypophysis is formed
from a dorsal outgrowth of this. Note its relation to the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following structures are formed from outgrowths of the
ectoderm at this stage:</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the visceral pouches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second, the median rudiment of the thyroid. This is an outgrowth
from the pharynx between the two hyoid arches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third, the rudimentary lungs, which develop in a pair from a
median ventral diverticulum of the alimentary tract, just behind the
last visceral pouch. The esophagus is just posterior to this. The
esophagus, very short at this stage, is continuous with a slightly
wider part that develops into the stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth, the first liver diverticulum, and, at a short distance
posterior to this, the second liver diverticulum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifth, the pancreas is at a point where the intestine opens ventrally.
It first appears as a slight thickening of the dorsal angle of
the intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixth, the ventral wall of the hind-gut forms a wide evagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seventh, the beginning of the allantois.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the whole series of transverse sections have been studied and
drawn, construct a longitudinal section of the fetus, including a
reconstruction of the alimentary tract.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this stage the <b>heart</b> is a simple tube. The following divisions
are distinctly visible: the auricular portion, the ventricular portion,
the sinus venosus, and the bulbus arteriosus. The union of the two
ductus Cuvieri and the ductus venosus form the sinus venosus. The
two ductus Cuvieri are formed by the union of the anterior and the
posterior cardinal veins. The ductus venosus is formed by the
union of the small right and the large left vitelline vein. These
latter veins return the blood from the yolk sac. The sinus venosus
empties into the single auricle above which it is located. The
single auricle is later divided into two chambers, the right and the
left auricle. At this stage it is widest in the lateral direction.
The auricle empties directly into the ventricle. The ventricle lies
ventrally and behind the auricle. This location is due to the bending
of the heart at this stage of development. Its hindmost portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>forms the future apex of the heart. If the series of sections be
studied from the posterior forward, the ventricle will be first to
appear in the sections. Just beneath the auricular portion of the
heart there is the bulbus arteriosus. The bulbus arteriosus soon
divides into a number of aortic arches. There is an ascending pair in
each of the visceral arches. The dorsal aorta is formed by the union
of the aortic arches above the visceral arches. The aortic arches are
first continued a short distance forward as the carotid arteries. The
dorsal, or posterior, aorta passes backward under the notochord.
The dorsal aorta divides into two parallel aortæ which give off on
each side the vitelline arteries. Note other branches of this aorta.</p>

<p class='c007'>The veins at this stage consist of the anterior and posterior cardinal,
the ductus venosus, the ductus Cuvieri, and the vitelline veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make drawing of the circulatory system after a completion of the
study of the series of sections.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a study of the <b>nervous system</b> according to hints already
given.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dorsal and the ventral roots of the spinal nerves are given off
separately, and secondarily unite. From the neuroblasts of the cord
there are at regular intervals outgrowths representing the ventral
roots. From the neural crest there develop segmental collections
of neuroblasts which form the spinal ganglia, from which the dorsal
spinal nerve roots develop. In fact this developmental stage can
be observed in embryos only forty-eight hours old, first appearing
as a line of cells springing on each side from the angle between
the neural canal tube and the external epiblast. In the section
from the embryo seventy-two hours old there are observed the
rudiments of the development of these spinal nerves. Four primary
ganglia develop in the neural crest of the head. These
ganglia are as follows: the acoustico-facialis ganglia, which is located
over the hyoid arch; the ganglia of the trigeminus, which is located
over the mandibular arch; the ganglia of the glosso-pharyngeus,
which is located over the third visceral arch; and the ganglia of the
vagus, which is located over the third and the fourth visceral cleft.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this stage of development the trigeminal and the acoustico-facialis
are clearly visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>On each side and dorsal to the aorta is noted the Wolffian body,
or mesonephros. The Wolffian body (Fig. 82, <i>E</i>) consists of a
series of tubules imbedded in the mesenchyme. The openings into
the Wolffian duct lie just beneath the cardinal vein.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>In a study of the <b>Wolffian duct</b> determine just how far anteriorly
and how far posteriorly it extends. Note whether it empties into
the cloaca.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each tube beginning in a blind extremity is later dilated. It has
a thin wall, and is situated near the median portion of the Wolffian
body. The tubule proper passing transversely, opens into the duct.
The upper wall of the thin walled part is invaginated by a mass of
mesenchyme that receives a small vessel from the dorsal aorta. The
Malpighian corpuscle, consisting of a glomerule and Bowman’s capsule,
is thus established. In the study of the four days old chick
note the further development of these parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of a chick four days, or ninety-six hours old, note to
what extent the yolk is covered by the blastoderm. It will be noted
that the embryo lies in the extra-embryonic cavity. This cavity is
bounded above by the chorion and below by the splanchno-pleure.
In removing the amnion from the embryo, note the relation to the
somatic umbilicus. Note the relation of the splanchnic umbilicus
to the splanchno-pleure. What relation has the allantois to the
above?</p>

<p class='c007'>In examining the head, locate the cerebral hemispheres, and note
their development. Locate the pineal gland. Note changes in the
olfactory pit and the eye. Locate the lens and the choroid fissure.
Note that the maxillary process of the mandibular arch lies beneath
the eye and behind the olfactory pits. Note the otocyst and the
relations of the other arches to the above structures.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of the <b>trunk</b>, note the tail, the allantois, Wolffian
ridges, the heart, and the condition and the position of the rudimentary
limbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make drawing of embryo from the side view. Carefully cut off
the head immediately behind the last visceral arch, and study and
draw the structures observed on the ventral side. Note the maxillary
processes, the mandibular and the hyoid arch, the nasal pits,
and the fronto-nasal process, which is just beginning its development.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of transverse sections observe from your drawing at
what level the section is made. Study and draw a section made
through the region of the anterior limbs. Note the spinal ganglion,
the muscle plate, or myotome, the condensation of mesenchyme
around the notochord, the pancreas, the liver, and the intestine;
and note the distribution of the mesenchyme. Note the ventral
roots of the spinal nerves, and the neuroblasts in the spinal cord.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>In sectioning the embryo from before backward, the first sections
will pass horizontally through the hindbrain and the midbrain
region. Note the parts, including the auditory vesicle. In the
first series of sections also locate the ganglia of the pneumogastric,
or vagus, the acoustico-facialis, the trigeminus, and the glosso-pharyngeal
nerves. Note the notochord and the cardinal veins.
After the disappearance of the ear, we observe the midbrain, which,
is located at one end of the section, and the cord at the other end.
The region between lies just above the pharynx. In the following
series study the visceral arches. Note the third pair of cranial, or
motor ocular, nerves. This latter nerve springs from the floor of
the midbrain. From the ventral prolongation of the floor of the
thalamencephalon there arises the infundibulum. The hypophysis
is located just beneath the infundibulum. At this stage the hypophysis
appears as a tube to empty into the mouth. This is an ingrowth
of the oral epithelium.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of a section through the center of the eye we should
observe the lens and optic stalk. This is in the region of the optic
chiasm. Note the choroid fissure and the pineal gland, the latter
appearing just beyond the eyes. Just forward lies the telencephalon,
or rudiments of the cerebral hemispheres.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a study of the <b>alimentary tract</b> we note that the mouth is
bounded by the mandibular arches. Note the maxillary processes,
and the ventral surface of the head. A finger-like diverticulum,
extending from the roof of the ruptured double membrane, formerly
separating the pharynx from the arches, forms the hypophysis.
The great development of the visceral pouches makes the pharynx
rather complex. In studying sections horizontally through the
pharyngeal region note the various visceral arches and pouches.
Note the arteries of the thyroid diverticulum.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the series note the changed development of the lung rudiments,
the glottis, the esophagus, the trachea, and the bronchi. The bronchi
appear in pairs. Note that the liver has assumed proportions,
and that it surrounds the common trunk of the vitelline veins,
which it divides into two parts. The sinus venosus lies close to the
heart. The ductus venosus is also surrounded by the liver. Above
the tip of the ventricle we note a dilatation which represents the
stomach. The hepatic, or bile duct is located immediately behind
the stomach. This duct is formed by the fusion of the right and the
left duct. Locate, draw, and describe the pancreas; trace the intestine;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>locate the splanchnic umbilicus, or yolk stalk; locate the allantois
stalk, and trace its connection with the hind-gut.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the series, locate and study the Wolffian ducts, the beginning
of the Müllerian duct, the embryonic kidney, or mesonephros, the
permanent kidney, or metanephros. The urino-genital ridge is
made up of all the above except the last named. The urino-genital
ridge forms a rounded projection on each side of the mesentery into
the dorsal angles of the body cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wolffian ducts empty into the cloaca. There are two ducts
which may be traced far forward, and which are found to extend
backward along the lateral margin of the ridge to the cloaca. Along
the greater part of their length we note tubules emptying into them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beginning near the anterior end of the urino-genital ridge, we note
that the Müllerian ducts arise from a thickened line of epithelium.
The greater part of the ridge is formed by the mesonephros. This is
made up of a series of tubules in each of which we may distinguish
two parts as follows: a tuft of capillaries from the aorta forming the
glomerules, surrounded by a thin walled invaginated capsule, making
up the Malpighian corpuscle; and the tubules proper. The
tubules lead from the corpuscles, or glomerules, to the Wolffian duct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The germinal epithelium constitutes the essential portions of the
gonad, or ovary, or testis. The germinal epithelium arises from a
thickening of the peritoneum of the median wall of the ridge. The
gonad is found near the anterior end of the ridge. At about this
age of the embryo there should appear the primitive ovary or testis.
Near the posterior termination of the Wolffian duct and from the
dorsal diverticulum there arises the ureter, or metanephros duct.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these series there should be studied the heart and circulation,
which will be found similar to the sections from the embryo seventy-two
hours old.</p>

<p class='c007'>Work out a summary of the relations of the allantois and the
yolk stalk to the intestines; the relations of the Wolffian ducts to the
intestines; the origin of the ureters from the Wolffian ducts; the
relations of the lungs, the liver, and the thyroid gland; the relations
of the blood-vessels; a study of the muscle plates; the relations of
epiphysis, hypophysis, infundibulum, mouth, and pharynx; the
relations of the vagus, or pneumogastric, trifacial, acoustico-facialis,
and glosso-pharyngeal nerves to the visceral arches.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the study of embryos at the end of each of the
first four days of incubation, a study should be made of preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>museum specimens each of which represents the development of a
day up to and including the twenty-first day.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE DERIVATIVES OF THE GERM-LAYERS</h3>

<p class='c015'>From the three primary germ-layers are developed the various
tissues and organs of the body by metamorphoses which may be
referred to the two fundamental processes of specialization, or the
adaptation of structure to function, and of unequal growth, which
latter results in the formation of folds, ridges, and constrictions.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the ectoderm are produced:</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidermis and its appendages, including the nails, the epithelium
in connection to the feathers and the feathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infoldings of the epidermis, including the epithelium of the
mouth, epithelium of the salivary glands and the anterior lobe of the
pituitary body, or hypophysis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium of the nasal tract with its glands and communicating
cavities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium lining the external auditory canal, including the
outer stratum of the membrana tympani.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lining of the anus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium of the conjunctiva and of the anterior part of the
cornea, the crystalline lens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spinal cord, the brain with its outgrowths, including the
optic nerve, the retina, and the posterior lobe of the pituitary body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium of the inner ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the entoderm are produced:</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium of the respiratory tract.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium of the digestive tract, from the back part of the
pharynx to the anus, including its associated glands, the liver, and
the pancreas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelial parts of the middle ear and of the eustachian tube.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epithelium of the thymus and the thyroid bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the mesoderm are developed:</p>

<p class='c007'>Connective tissue in all its modified forms, such as bone, cartilage,
lymph, blood, fibrous and areolar tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Muscle tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'>All endothelial cells, as of joint-cavities, bursal sacs, lymph
sacs, blood-vessels, pericardium, and endocardium, pleura, and
peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spleen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The kidneys and ureters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The testicles and the system of excretory ducts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ovary and oviduct.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PREPARATION OF STRUCTURES FOR STUDY</h3>

<p class='c015'>It is hoped that the following suggestions will be helpful in the
laboratory work.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Directions for Dissecting Muscles.</b>—The muscles that are brought
into great play in movements of the bird’s limbs are dark carmine
in color, while those which are not brought greatly into use are pale
or white in color.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tendons are made up of white fibrous connective tissue, are
very dense, and pearly white in color.</p>

<p class='c007'>In securing a bird for dissection of muscles it is best to select one
in rather poor flesh, as the fat is annoying. The bird may be
chloroformed or killed in a bell jar by aid of illuminating gas.
After the bird is dead pluck all the feathers and immerse it in a 10
per cent. solution of formaldehyde or of 80 per cent. alcohol. It is
best to puncture the abdominal wall so that the fluid may at once
fill the abdominal cavity and more readily gain access to the chest
cavity; and to puncture the skin at various points so that the liquid
may more quickly become disseminated among the muscular structures.
Post-mortem changes quickly take place if these precautions
are not taken. The liquid surrounding the carcass should be at
least twice the quantity of the bulk of the carcass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first dissection should be to lay bare the dermal muscles.
The dermal muscles are of two kinds, true dermal and dermo-osseous.
The dermal muscles have their origin and insertion in the skin,
and control the movements of the different groups of feathers. The
dermo-osseous have their origin on some part of the skeleton, and
insert to the integuments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dermal muscles vary with the characteristics of the bird, we
do not find all the known dermal muscles in any one specimen. A
cock of the Cornish breed will show these muscles best developed.
Birds possess an enormous system of minute muscles divided up into
an infinite number of fasciculi, to act harmoniously upon the feather
quills and to agitate collectively the plumage. By the aid of a low-power
lens the action of the feather muscles in the large quill butts
of the wing or the tail may be studied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The muscles may be studied in groups as outlined in the text.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Make an incision through the skin down to the bone on the superior
part of the head, parallel and close to the base of the upper mandible,
and extending completely across. From the outer end of this make
an incision backward and down to the skull and posteriorly. The
muscles of the upper part of the neck will then be exposed. The
straight incision should extend to about a half inch on the inside of
the upper eyelid of the same side. Reflect the flap of skin from the
top of the skull, and carefully examine the under side of it in the
median line, where it overlies the frontal region. The dermo-frontalis
will be observed if it be present. In many birds, especially in
females, it may not be discernible, and may be considered absent.
To expose the circumconcha make an incision completely around
the ear; then carefully dissect to the ear base. A dermal circular
muscle should be observed. To expose the dermo-temporalis
extend the longitudinal incision down the back of the neck to a
point between the clavicular heads, carrying it just through the
skin and about one-fourth of an inch to the side of the median line.
Remove the skin from the throat and the anterior portion of the
chest. Lay open the alar and parapatagial duplicatures of the skin.
This exposes a number of dermal muscles. The dermo-temporalis
is now observed to extend from a small depression just above and
anterior to the temporal fossa. It makes slight attachments to the
temporal muscle, which it covers, and extends backward as a thin
ribbon-shaped muscle, the fibers blending with those of the cleido-trachealis,
and becomes lost upon the skin in front and opposite the
shoulder-joint. At times its fibers blend with those of the dermo-tensor
patagii.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the musculature of the fowl is loosely arranged, the rest of the
dissection is easily done if care be exercised.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ligaments may be dissected after the completion of the study
of muscles, using the same subject or, a two pound broiler be prepared
by killing in the gas chamber, plucking the feathers and
parboiling just till the flesh becomes tender and is easily removed,
it will be observed that all structures can be removed from the
points exposing the ligaments distinctly. The ligaments appear
swollen and more easily observed for study.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Directions for the Study of the Viscera.</b>—Carefully remove the
right and the left abdominal and thoracic walls, allowing a strip
of tissue to remain in the median line to hold the organs in their
normal position. To open these cavities it is necessary to use the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>bone saw and the scalpel. The organs may now be studied from
each side. To make a longitudinal section through the median line,
select a small bird, one weighing not more than 2 pounds, kill,
and preserve in a 10 per cent. solution of formaldehyde for three
days. Then with a sharp, thin, long-bladed knife make an incision
at one sweep through the median line of the body down to the back
bone, and with the bone saw section through the vertebræ. If it is
difficult to cut through the breast-bone, saw through before making
the incision. In small birds the entire cut may be made without
the aid of the saw.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Directions for the Study of Arteries.</b>—Arteries should be injected.
Veins are usually more or less filled with blood so that the tracing of
these is not so difficult as the tracing of uninjected arteries. Nerves
are white and no difficulty is usually encountered in tracing them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The courses of arteries, veins, and nerves are side by side, and
many of them, as in mammals, are arranged in the order of veins,
arteries, nerves, the veins being in front.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injection apparatus consists of the following parts: air-compression
chamber, to which is attached a pressure pump. A manometer
made of glass tubing 6 millimeters in diameter, inside measurement.
This tube is partly filled with mercury, and a scale in centimeters
is made from the top of the right-hand tube (Fig. 84, No. 8).
This ruling, or gauge, should be about 15 centimeters long. Extending
from the right extremity of the U-tube is a small rubber tubing
which is attached to the chamber containing the injection fluid;
and extending from the inferior part of this chamber is another tubing
which has the injection needle attached to the free end.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injection should be done under 120 millimeters pressure.
The stop cock of the pressure chamber is released sufficiently to
raise the mercury in the U-tube six centimeters, which multiplied
by 2, the amount of work required to raise two columns, makes 120
millimeters pressure. If this pressure be maintained, all vessels
should be injected without rupture. The same process may be used
in injecting the air cells through the trachea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injecting material may consist of one part finely sifted plaster
of Paris, four parts water, and sufficient gentian violet to make a
violet color. For the coloring, red aniline may be used in preparing
this material. The dye should be dissolved in the water to be used
in making the injection liquid. Caution must be used and the
work rapidly done, as the plaster soon sets, or becomes solid, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>needle or in the tubing. A small cannula should be used, since
the endothelial lining of the arteries are easily injured and difficulty
may thus be created.</p>

<p class='c007'>Select for arterial dissection an old cock, as in a bird of this kind
the arteries are larger and the difficulties are reduced. Select for
bleeding and injection the ischiadic artery in the thigh region. With
the sharp point of the thin blade of a knife make an incision lengthwise
of the artery being careful not to strip back the endothelial
lining of the artery. Allow as much of the blood as will escape
before injecting; in fact, the arteries should be thoroughly emptied,
so that there is no longer danger of a clot’s plugging some vessel
and thus preventing its filling. Since the blood of most birds coagulates
in about thirty seconds, this work must be done rapidly, care
being exercised to keep the flow running as long as possible. After
bleeding is completed, insert the cannula and tie the vessel tightly
around the cannula to prevent the escape of the injecting fluid. See
that all connections are sufficiently tight to prevent the escape of
liquid under pressure. After the injection is completed, remove the
cannula and tie the artery with a small twine, preferably cotton.
Quickly remove all injecting fluid from the needle, the tubing, and the
injecting chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the operation of bleeding the cock may be chloroformed,
care being taken not to administer chloroform to kill him; for it is
necessary to maintain life as long as possible so that the heart may
be kept beating and all blood possible drained from the arteries.
After the injection is completed the bird may be plucked and immersed
in the preservative fluid in the same manner as in the
preparation for dissection for muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arteries, the veins, and the nerves may now be dissected and
studied in relation to one another and in relation to the muscles,
the bones, and other structures. The skin should not be removed
from the shanks till it is desired to dissect these parts, as the tissues
quickly dry out. In fact, the tendons of the shanks and toes can
best be dissected while the specimen is fresh.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>A Study of the Structure of Bones.</b>—Longitudinal and transverse
sections of old bone may be made by making thin longitudinal and
transverse sections with the bone saw, and then by making them
very thin with a fine three-cornered file. Examining under the
low power microscope, we note the lacunæ, the canaliculi, and the
Haversian system.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Similar sections in green bone may be studied if prepared as
follows. Secure specimen of bone just removed from a fowl and
place it for three days in a 10 per cent. aqueous solution of hydrochloric
acid. Test by puncturing with a needle, and, if all the
mineral salts are removed, place in a water bath and wash for four
hours. Pass it through the fluids usually employed in preparing
specimens for sectioning with the microtome. Stain as sections of
other tissue for microscopic study. See the description below. If
the ends of the bone be included, it will enable the student to study
not only compact bone but also cancellated bone and articular, or
hyaline cartilage, and in some of the bones, as the femur, the red
marrow.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Special Technic for the Dissection of Cranial and Spinal Nerves.</b>—It
is rather difficult to dissect the cranial and spinal nerves of the
fowl, owing to the fact that the structures are very small. The
bone is rather hard and the nerve tissue so delicate that great skill
must be attained to achieve any degree of success.</p>

<p class='c007'>A simple technic has been developed as follows: Place the head
and neck, or other structures of the spinal column in a 10 per cent.
aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid for three or more days, the
time depending on the size of the specimen and the amount of soft
structures surrounding it. This solution removes all the calcium
salts from the bone and makes the removal of the bony structures
a less difficult task.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Directions for the Study of Soft Structures.</b>—Secure a specimen of
the tissue to be studied—lung, muscle, intestine, liver, pancreas—from
a normal fowl just killed. The specimen should be not more
than ½ inch square. After first hardening three days in 10 per
cent. formaldehyde. Pass through the following fluids:</p>

<p class='c007'>Eosin is sold in two forms, that soluble in water and that soluble
in alcohol. The eosin soluble in water is preferred, because with it
a greater degree of diffusion in stain can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Keep on hand a saturated aqueous solution and dilute with water
as needed. The strength of the solution to be used varies somewhat
with the tissue and the reagent in which it is to be fixed; but usually
the strength should be between ⅒ and ½ per cent. when eosin is
used after hematoxylin. The diluted solutions should contain 25
per cent. of alcohol, otherwise they will not keep well. When eosin
is used before an aniline dye, such as methylene blue, a 5 per cent.
or even a saturated solution should be used.</p>

<p class='c007'>A small piece of thymol must be placed on the top of the liquid
in each jar, or mold will develop and spoil the specimen.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>To Make Specimens Transparent.</b>—Specimens may be rendered
transparent by the method of Spalteholz.</p>

<p class='c007'>The steps are essentially as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>I. Preparation of the fresh tissue. If any parts are to be made
conspicuous, as blood-vessels, or the lymphatic system, they must
be injected with an insoluble, unbleachable substance. Spalteholz
recommended carmine or methylene blue, and carbon. I have
found Higgin’s ordinary black carbon ink excellent for this purpose.
The system or systems are injected with this substance while the
tissue is perfectly fresh.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. Fixation. The tissues are fixed preferably in 10 per cent.
formalin. The length of time for fixation depends on the size of
the tissue. In formalin it requires from eight hours upward to fix
completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. Rinsing. Running tap water for five or ten minutes accomplishes
the rinsing. If it is impracticable to pass directly into the
bleaching fluid, the tissues may be kept temporarily in 60 per cent.
or 70 per cent. alcohol. They should then be rinsed again thoroughly
in water when ready to bleach.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. Bleaching. The bleaching fluid used is hydrogen peroxid
to which ammonia is added until a white precipitate forms. The
proportion is approximately two parts of peroxid and one of
ammonia. The material is bleached until all the color is removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>and the tissue looks perfectly clear or slightly opaque. It may be
quite transparent as the protein coagulate is somewhat white, but
all yellow or reddish color should be bleached away.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. Washing. Rinse thoroughly in running tap water or through
several changes of water until the odor of ammonia is quite gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>VI. Dehydration. Pass gradually through alcohol solutions, 30
per cent., 50 per cent., 60 per cent., 70 per cent., 80 per cent., 95
per cent., and last through absolute alcohol. The time required
for dehydration will vary with the size of the material, but in either
95 per cent. solution or in absolute alcohol the tissue should remain
until well hardened, twenty-four hours or more. Dehydration is
completed by passing from absolute alcohol, to a fluid one-half
absolute alcohol and one-half benzol; thence for a few days to pure
benzol.</p>

<p class='c007'>VII. Clarifying. From benzol the material is finally clarified
in winter-green oil or any other standard clearer, and put up in its
final position in the museum jar.</p>

<p class='c007'>In commenting on this method Dr. A. F. Contant says: “I have
found this to work very successfully in the injection of the lymphatics
of the human skin, which, as you know, is a rather delicate
injection and has been difficult of demonstration by other methods.
With this method, however, I have prepared whole portions, as the
side of the face, the leg, etc., of small animals and embryos which
show clearly the whole course of the lymphatic vessels and nodes, in
situ, and their relations to surrounding parts.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EQUIPMENT FOR THE DISSECTION LABORATORY</h3>

<p class='c015'>Figure 84 illustrates some essential equipment for the dissection
laboratory. The equipment should consist of a pump, No. 1, which
forces air through the rubber tube, No. 2, into the pressure tank, No.
4, which is guarded by the valve at No. 3. A dial, No. 5, indicates
the pressure of the air within the tank. The air as needed is released
through an outlet valve. The air now passes through the
rubber tube, No. 6, into the left arm of the manometer at No. 7.
The manometer is simply a glass tubing filled with mercury to the
point indicated at No. 7. By the side of the opposite arm there is
made a scale graduated in centimeters. The tube at No. 9 being
attached to the Y-tube, conveys air under the same pressure into
the injection chamber as that supporting the column of mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of the manometer. It is necessary to have a pinch cock, as indicated
at No. 11, to control the liquid within the tube. No. 12
illustrates the tube in the end of which, No. 13, there is inserted a
trocar which is introduced into the artery and tightly tied with a
cord.</p>
